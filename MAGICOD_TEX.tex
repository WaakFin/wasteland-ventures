\chapter{Introduction}
\begin{quote}
	\emph{``They may have scorched the earth and reduced our lands to rubble, but the zebras could never quench the magic coursing through Equestria. Unicorns, pegasi, earth ponies, and beyond, we all possess the power to very literally change the world around us. The rest of Tenpony might say this is a waste of time, laugh at my choice of dedication, but they're short-sighted. My goal is to interview the masters of magic in all its forms, so we can preserve its essence for future generations. If you are reading this, I can only assume you're part of this future.''}
	
	\emph{- Nebula Dance, Librarian, 2 BS\&R}
\end{quote}

The Equestrian Wasteland has plenty of magical encounters to offer, be it in the form of unicorns mastering the arcane or pegasi coursing through the sky with grace. Some could argue even the Earth Ponies, the most mundane of equine kind, possess their unique form of magic. And in this case, they are true in their assumptions.

This document of \emph{\textbf{Wasteland Ventures}} holds most common variants of magic found in the Equestrian Wasteland. For easier search, the magic spells and maneuvers have been listed in alphabetical order under each variant of magic.

Common themes found in almost magic are listed below, and can also be found under Chapter 8 of \emph{\textbf{Core Rules}} of \emph{\textbf{Wasteland Ventures}}:

\begin{description}
	\item[AP Cost:] All spells cost some Action Points. Outside of combat, this value tends to have no effect.
	\item[Area of Effect:] How large an area the spell covers.
	\item[Duration:] How long the spell lasts
	\item[Potency:] determines the power of spells, taking into account the character's level and the school's associated SPECIAL attribute.
	\item[Range:] How far the spell's target can be, if at all.
	\item[School:] The "magic school" of the spell, followed by the associated SPECIAL attribute.
	\item[Strain Cost:] determines the amount of fatigue gained by casting the spell. 
	\item[Target:] Determines if the spell can be casted on oneself, to others, or to an area.
	
\end{description} 


\chapter{Aerial Maneuvers}
\begin{quote}
	\emph{``Listen up, squeak. Back in my day, any pegasus worth their mettle was expected to do most basic aerial maneuvers with their eyes closed. Pegasi today can barely flap their wings, and use fancy schmancy power armor to make up for their inability to fly properly. Am I old and crabby? Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong!''}
	
	\emph{- Lieutenant Citrus Breeze, Former Shadowbolt, 5 BS\&R}
\end{quote}

Basic Maneuvers are the maneuvers every flying character can learn, or has learned already, once their adventure starts. The maneuvers are divided in three categories: \textbf{Agility}, \textbf{Charisma}, and \textbf{Endurance}. Agility maneuvers require reflexes and dexterity from the flier in order to pull off successfully, whereas Charisma maneuvers ask for certain grace and bravado like Wonderbolts of yore. Endurance maneuvers require two simple things: guts and thick skin to sustain the forces of the maneuvers.

\medskip
The flier flies around a cloud in top speed, gathering electricity  and then dives towards enemy at neck-breaking speed. When the character comes to a halt, she releases an Area of Effect - lightning attack on a Small Splash Template.

The distance the character can dive to is within a Huge Splash Template from her starting position. This Electric AoE attack covers a Small Splash Template and deals 2+(3) damage to non-robots, while Robots take three times the damage and Power Armor takes twice the damage. \textbf{Potency} of the character will add more damage to the maneuver:

\medskip

The flier dashes fast enough to create a contrail behind them while flying low enough to distract their enemy. The flier gives all enemies they fly past a Distraction, its severity determined by the flier's Potency. Flier must fly in a straight line. The enemies will suffer from the distraction for 2 turns, and cannot use their Attacks of Opportunity against the flier during the maneuver.

\medskip

The flier speeds up, flying towards the enemy and bombarding them with gunfire or magical energy, targeting enemies in a line at the maximum of Potency*2 meters (Potency hexes).

The Maneuver requires a successful Firearms/MEW roll in addition to the Thaumaturgy roll. The weapon in question must be a Full-Auto weapon. 

If the Thaumaturgy roll fails, the flier ends up on the ground while knocked prone, having not spend any ammunition. If the Firearms/MEW roll fails, the flier has performed the maneuver, but misses the targets.

	\end{tblr}
	
\medskip

The flier makes a quick flip on the spot, whipping up a dust cloud with their wings once they right themselves. 

The maneuver creates a cloud adjacent to the target, the size of which is a Small Splash template. Anyone caught in the cloud suffers a distraction penalty as determined by the flier's Potency. After two turns, the cloud dissipates.

\medskip

The flier makes a circular flight around the target, striking them with Melee or Unarmed attacks. Flier returns to the same location where she set off at the beginning of the maneuver.

This attack costs the combined AP cost of all attacks the flier wants to commit, and only the attacks - the flier spends no AP to move to or from the target. However, Flier has -5 AP less to use during her next turn. Flier may use Special Attacks granted by her weapons during the maneuver.

This Maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

\medskip

Flier weaves in the air as they fly, making them an even harder target to hit than by actively dodging. This maneuver requires a successful Thaumaturgy roll to pull off.

All enemies that target her during this maneuver's duration gain a Distraction penalty, the severity of which is determined by the flier's \textbf{Potency}:

\medskip

Flier makes a dainty twirl near the ground, dispelling fog, poisonous clouds or put out small fires in an area determined by her Potency. Additionally, the flier may instead spread these effects to an equally sized area, in case of fire or smoke. This maneuver also removes Burning-status from all targets within the affected area. Thaumaturgy roll is required, and the area of effect must be adjacent to the character.

\medskip

The flier makes a straight dashing line towards the target, and takes a sharp turn upwards leaving behind a flash of bright light on an area determined by their Potency.

Thaumaturgy roll is required to successfully perform. The targets in the affected area - excluding the flier, while centered on them - have to roll CHA or become Blinded for 3 turns.

If the Thaumaturgy roll fails, the character remains in air, but the effects of the maneuver do not happen. AP is depleted, but Strain is not.

The flier stays close to the ground while flying, leaving behind a trail of fire that burns all that come into contact with it. 

After successfully starting this maneuver, any movement the flier makes until the end of their turn leaves behind a burning section that lasts for \textbf{Potency}/2 turns. Anyone caught in it or passing through the flaming area take 1+(3) damage and have to succeed in END check or gain Burning status effect. 

A successful Thaumaturgy roll is required to perform this Maneuver.

\medskip

Sun Celebration is a bit more difficult of a maneuver to pull off in the often-cloudy Wasteland: As her first action, the flier must disperse clouds from a Small Splash Template with a Thaumaturgy check. Dispersing the clouds costs 5 AP, and the dispersed clouds gather back after 5 turns. This action costs no Strain.

As her second action, she positions herself in front of the sun in a bright display of glory, causing a Distraction to all who look upon her and fail a PER roll. The positioning costs 6 AP and 4 Strain, and this Distraction lasts for 2 Turns.

Flier can further worsen or improve the weather conditions, making visibility in an area one step further from the current condition. For example, a light drizzle of rain (-5 Visibility penalty) would become a downpour (-10 Visibility Penalty) if worsened, or clear skies (no penalty) if improved. The maximum area that is affected by this spell is determined by the caster's \textbf{Potency}. Thaumaturgy roll is required.

The flier circles low to the ground, the size of her circular motion  determined by their Potency. The air pressure and gale from their maneuver protects all allies inside the circle, providing additional +1 DT to them. The affected area is centered on the flier's original position.

To perform this maneuver, the flier must successfully roll Thaumaturgy -20 or be flown off course for 10 meters (5 hexes) and get knocked prone in a random direction.

GM decides the direction a failed maneuverer flies towards with a roll of the dice, 1d6 for each main direction. If they crash against someone, they take damage according to Falling Objects and Falling rules.

The Flier grabs onto a target and drags the target along the ground for 8 meters (4 hexes) to the direction of their choosing, injuring them in the process. 

This maneuver requires a successful opposed roll of flier's Thaumaturgy against the target's STR. If the target is successful, the flier ends up on the ground, in a grapple with the target. This maneuver deals 2+(2) damage to the target if flier is successful, and the flier's Potency provides additional damage:

The Flier takes off up to the air and dives down, making a single powerful Melee or Unarmed attack with high chance of Knocking down the target.

This maneuver requires a successful Thaumaturgy roll as well as either Melee or Unarmed roll to pull off, depending on the weapon being used. If both are successful, the attack deals additional damage according to the caster's Potency. Flier gets a free Trip attempt after a successful hit, with a bonus of +20 on their Opposed roll.

The flier grabs their target and carries them high to the sky, then throws the target plummeting towards ground. Requires a successful opposed roll of the Flier's Thaumaturgy -10 against the target's STR. Targets beyond one Size Increment larger than the flier are impossible to lift. For instance, a Size 0 flier cannot lift a Size 2 target.

The target takes 3+(4) damage, and ends up Prone on the ground. The flier's \textbf{Potency} provides additional damage to the maneuver:

Flier soars high in the air, then dives down to deliver a shock wave that explodes around her in a multi-colored mushroom cloud when a successful Thaumaturgy roll is made.

Initial blast deals 2+(5) damage, with the flier's Potency providing additional damage. Everyone caught in the attack may attempt to stay upright from the blast with a successful STR -1 roll, or be knocked prone from the attack. The flier being in the center of the blast does not take damage nor gets knocked prone.

If the flier is a ghoul, they inflict an additional 1 Rad at 3x40\% alongside the damage. However, this will deplete their accumulated rads by half to a minimum of 1.

The flier takes to the sky, scouting the area for hostile targets' precise positions and relaying the info back to their team with a intricate flight pattern. A Thaumaturgy -10 roll is required to execute this maneuver.

The intricate flight pattern is automatically known by other player characters, but ally NPCs have to decipher the meaning with a successful PER-1 roll.

This Aerial Maneuver provides +10 to all combat skills to the allies, but doesn't benefit the flier. If the Thaumaturgy roll fails, the flier becomes a target for the opponents, with the enemy getting a +10 in combat skills to attack the flier.

The flier performs a quick dash up in the sky, causing a shift in air pressure. All targets within an area dependent on the flier's Potency, centered on the flier, suffer from considerable dizziness.

All targets must make an opposed END-2 roll against the flier's END. Afflicted targets have all their actions cost 2 AP more and suffer from Medium Distraction, for 3 turns.

If Flier is a ghoul, Radiation is also emitted, with 2 Rads at 2x60\%. This also depletes their radiation reserves completely.

The Flier makes a series of stunning and complicated flying routines, either inspiring their allies or intimidating their opponents in a Large Splash template for 3 turns. Thaumaturgy -20 roll is required for successful maneuvering.

Before executing the maneuver, the flier must decide if they want to boost their allies or demoralize their enemies. On a success, the effects he has chosen happen.

\begin{itemize}
	\item	If the Flier boosts their allies, they gain +10 to all Skill and SPECIAL rolls.
	\item If the Flier demoralizes their enemies, the enemies get a -10 to all skills and SPECIAL rolls.

The flier attacks their target once during the low-flight part of the first loop, picks up speed to perform the second loop where they descend onto the same target to trample them.

The maneuver requires a Thaumaturgy -20 roll to succeed. On a success, the flier makes a Melee or Unarmed attack with additional damage, and causes a status effect. The target of this attack may resist the status effect with a -2 END roll.

The flier may choose one of the following status effects to inflict when she decides to execute the maneuver: Bleeding, Blinded, or Stunned.

In addition, the damage gets a boost depending on the caster's Potency:

The Flier dashes towards a target, flying around and striking them like a murder of crows or pride of lions, with the use of her beak and talons.

The flier can attack multiple targets within an area determined by her Potency, centered on her original position. She strikes with Unarmed attacks as many times as her AP pool allows, with all attacks costing 1 AP less (minimum 1) and dealing additional +(1) damage per strike. She may choose to attack one target or multiple, and after she is unable to attack she ends up adjacent to the last target of her maneuver. The remaining AP cannot be spent on any actions afterwards.

At the end of her turn, the flier can choose to continue the maneuver on her next turn. She must make an AGI/END/CHA roll to successfully keep the maneuver going, with a cumulative penalty of 1 after each successive round. If the roll is unsuccessful, she will fall to the ground and is knocked prone.

The Flier takes a hovering position in the air, sending gusts of powerful winds in a Large Splash template adjacent to them, causing Medium Distraction. Those within the area of the maneuver can make an opposed END roll against flier's AGI/END/CHA to only suffer a Minor Distraction. Anyone going in or through the area of effect must also do the opposed roll. If Flier has the perk \textit{Roar}, she can combine effects of both to cause the distraction last an additional turn, and on a critical success, cause a Major Distraction instead. 

After executing this maneuver, the flier's next turn starts with 5 AP less, and with an inability to use her wings during this turn.

The targets' END resistance depends on the flier's Potency as follows:

The flier picks up speed from her current position, flying straight up fast enough to break the sound barrier and release a multi-colored sonic boom. The sonic boom causes clouds to disperse and deals damage to all in a Huge Splash template. This maneuver requires a successful Thaumaturgy -20 check to execute.

The attack deals 4+(5) damage, with the flier's Potency determining additional dice for the attack. If the flier is a ghoul, they instead perform the Sonic Radboom, which in addition to damage and cloud dispersing deals 2 Rads at 5x60\%. This will deplete the flier's Radiation Tracker completely.

The flier flies so fast that they are set on fire, after which the flier will ram their opponent, spreading the fire at any adjacent characters to the target in a Small Splash Template. Thaumaturgy -10 roll is required for successful maneuvering.

When successfully performing this maneuver, the initial opponent takes 2+(5) damage, with additional damage provided by the flier's Potency. The target may also suffer a Burning status effect, with -1 END to resist. Any characters within range sans the flier and the initial target may also get Burning status but do not otherwise take damage. If the flier fails their Thaumaturgy roll, they get the Burning-status effect without any checks to resist.

The flier carries a single target, an ally or an enemy, to a more favorable position in the battlefield. The flier chooses one target within Huge Splash Template, making a Thaumaturgy -20 check.

On a success, the flier flies to the target, picks the target up and moves them up to her Potency*2 meters (Potency hexes) from the target's original position, ending up adjacent to the target after the maneuver. These movements do not provoke Attacks of Opportunity. On a failure, the flier ends up knocked prone next to her target, having not moved it at all. Targets beyond one (1) Size Increment larger than the flier are impossible to lift.

\chapter{Earth Pony Magic}

\begin{quote}
	\emph{``Contrary to what most unicorns or pegasi would tell you, us earth ponies are just as magical! Sure, we may not sneeze rainbows or fart lightning, but that doesn't mean our magic is nonexistent. What, you thought we could raise a barn in an afternoon without some arcane tricks up our sleeves?''}
	
	\emph{- Sugar Bounce, Caravaneer, 4 BS\&R}
\end{quote}

The magic of Earth Ponies is heavily tied to the earth and their community, and often channeled through their very own being. This proves to be their hindrance when it comes to new spells, as Earth Ponies do not "learn" new ways of magic. They instead discover them naturally as they gain experience in the wastes.

The Earth Pony magic is divided in three branches: \textbf{Charm}, \textbf{Sight}, and \textbf{Might}. Branch of Charm involves soft words and care, while Branch of Sight links the senses of the Earth Pony with their natural affinity to the ground. Branch of Might often asks for brute strength, often beyond mundane, to pull the task through.

Caster inspires up to 5 allies with a magically enchanted praise. A successful Thaumaturgy roll is required for casting this spell.

The caster chooses which one of the following boons she will give, if successful:

\medskip
\begin{compactitem}
	\item +10 to a single non-combat skill, except Thaumaturgy
	\item +5 to a single combat skill
	\item +5 to Thaumaturgy-skill

	\item +10 to any Opposed Roll
	\item Move 2 meters (1 hex) for free
\end{compactitem}

The sensible Earth Pony uses their innate magic fueled into their voice to help a single ally to calm down from a Panic-Pain Threshold during combat situations. The character doesn't suffer from a Pain Threshold until they take further damage.

Outside of combat, this spell can be used to lower one's Insanity by 1 point, to a minimum of 0. If the target has acquired half or more of their maximum Insanity points, the caster suffers a -10 to their Thaumaturgy roll.

When used to overcome Insanity, this spell cannot be used again in 24 hours to lower Insanity, but can be used to calm down a target from Panic. A critically successful Thaumaturgy-roll causes the Insanity to lower by 2.

If the Insanity-lowering effect is used on an opponent, a CHA Opposed roll is required. If successful, the opponent temporarily becomes more lucid, but not necessarily docile.

\begin{verse}
	\textbf{Example:} Shining Example attempts to use Comforting Words to lower Maabara's Insanity, after she suffered a devastating blow to her psyche courtesy of in-game events. Maabara's maximum insanity is 6, and she currently has 4 points. Because Maabara has more than half of her maximum Insanity points, Shining Example's Thaumaturgy suffers a penalty of -10 to successfully perform this spell.

The caster can enhance the qualities of a number of plants, such as giving a thorny plant longer thorns and making the plant more damaging, a poisonous plant enhanced with a more potent toxin or a fresh fruit tree to become more nutritious.
A successful Thaumaturgy roll is required for casting this spell.

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	4 plants
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	8 plants
		\item[20+ Potency] 	    12 plants
	\end{description}
\end{quote}

The spell requires that the plant in question has been planted in soil, either in the ground or in a flower pot for the spell to work.

The mechanical effects of this spell should be discussed with the GM as it is case-by-case basis on what plants are in the area. It is to be noted that this spell cannot be used to make plants Rad-free.

Most of these magical effects are difficult to spot, but a successful -10 Thaumaturgy or -2 INT roll will reveal the enhanced nature of the plant.
Once the spell is cast, the effect will remain on the plant indefinitely unless a Failsafe-spell is cast or the original caster decides to cancel the effect.

Character can only have a limited number of enchanted plants, and if she wishes to enhance a new plant after having reached her limit, a previously enhanced plant loses its enhancement, chosen by the caster.

Earth pony draws the energies from the earth and directs it towards their ally, giving one of the following boons. The following list are instant effects, curing the associated penalties:

\medskip
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Heal a physical status effect, such as Bleeding.
	\item Help an Unconscious ally back on their feet.
	\item Ally has SPECIAL damage healed.
	\item Ally has HP damage healed.
\end{compactitem}
\medskip

The amount of SPECIAL and HP damage healed depends on the caster's Potency as follows:

\begin{quote}

		\item[10-19 Potency] 	2 points
		\item[20+ Potency] 	    4 points

\end{quote}

The following boons have a duration, and their penalties will return once the spell ends:

\medskip
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Ally can ignore one Crippled-condition for the duration of the spell.
	\item Ally can ignore one Pain Threshold penalty for the duration of the spell.

Allows the Earth pony to share the effects of the next self-targeting spell she casts with up to 5 allies. However, these allies must be close to the caster for this spell's effect to work, as the spell is centered on the caster. When using this spell in tandem with a spell, it adds +2 to the spells' original AP cost and Strain cost.

A successful Thaumaturgy roll is required for casting this spell.

The area of effect is determined by the caster's Potency:
\begin{quote}

The earth pony channels their magic to compel any nearby Plant mutant to help them for the duration of the spell. If the Thaumaturgy roll fails, no plant appears.

The plant acts on the enemy's turn, and acts independently from the caller, though the earth pony can give suggestions to the plant that the mutated bush may follow through with.

After the spell ends, the plant disappears.

The earth pony quickly familiarizes themselves with the terrain, avoiding the worst possible spots to step on. A successful Thaumaturgy roll is required for casting this spell. 

On a success, the earth pony ignores the +1 AP cost of Difficult Terrain and Movement AP costs on Climbing and Crawling. In addition, the character can now charge in Difficult Terrain. A critical success lowers the AP cost of Climbing and Crawling with an additional -1.

The caster channels their magic to the plants near them, enriching the plantlife to grow faster. A successful Thaumaturgy roll is required for casting this spell.

This spell causes a spot chosen by the caster to grow thick with underbrush and roots, making a Large Splash template area into a Difficult Terrain.

In addition, any creature between Size -2 and +2 has to make an Opposed STR roll when traversing through this area or be Knocked Prone by the plants. The plants use the caster's STR as their stat for rolling. If the creature fails in the Opposed roll, she drops Prone and becomes entangled with the plants; getting up from Prone costs 2 AP extra. 

Sizes 3-4 trample over the plants while sizes -3 to -4 simply slip through. When the spell ends, the plants return to their normal size.

\medskip

The caster kicks the ground to release a small tremor in the earth, to raise up a platform to create a cover made from stone. This cover has a DT of 2. The caster's Potency gives the Cover extra DT as follows:

\newpage

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	+0 DT
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	+1 DT
		\item[20+ Potency] 	    +2 DT
	\end{description}	
\end{quote}

If a character is standing on the spot the caster uses to make the cover, the character flies up into the air and might fall prone from the impact, adjacent to the cover. There is an Opposed STR roll to see if the target falls prone. In addition, the character takes 2+(3) damage, with Potency adding damage dice as follows:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	+0 DMG die
		\item[11-20 Potency] 	+1 DMG die
		\item[20+ Potency] 	    +2 DMG die
	\end{description}	
\end{quote}

This spell can be used to create pathways where there are none or to otherwise manipulate terrain outside of combat.
It can also be created to make small shelters, though the result is far from comfortable lodging. Said shelter is just barely big enough to house the player party, and sleeping in it doesn't incur Sleep Deprivation. A critical success when creating the shelter gives the characters the Well-Rested status if they rest in it, due to the shelter being more secure and better crafted.

A successful Thaumaturgy roll is required for casting this spell.

The Earth Pony receives small magical cues from the earth itself, giving her cryptic warnings of possible danger such as tail twitching or shaky hoof. A successful Thaumaturgy roll is required for casting this spell.

In combat, this spell gives an extra penalty of 5 to first dodge action.

Outside of combat, this spell gives a +1 to AGI to dodge falling objects or creatures about to crash you, as well as +1 to PER to detect ambushes and traps.

\textbf{Example:} Shining Example uses Earthly Warning to dodge an enemy's action, using 2 AP to dodge, normally giving the enemy -10 to attack. With Earthly Warning, Shining Example gets an additional 5 added to this penalty, making the enemy's attack penalty -15 instead.

The Earth Pony channels their inner magic to enchant a Cover to be stronger than it was for 3 rounds, the applied strength depending on their Potency. A successful Thaumaturgy roll is required for casting this spell. A critical success on Thaumaturgy- skill roll upgrades the Cover by additional +1 DT.

The amount of DT that the Earth Pony can improve the cover with is dependent on their current Potency as follows:

The caster enhances their hooves and becomes capable of sensing movement via earth's tremors as if they were directly touched. When this spell is active, the caster ignores any penalties to their Perception rolls against sneaking characters with their legs on the ground.

In addition, if this spell is active when combat starts, they get to do one action before rolling for initiative, as a response to a threat they sensed coming. As such, they ignore the AP cost for said action. This spell cannot be cast while in combat.

The caster has to have at least one hoof on the ground for the spell to work.

\chapter{Unicorn Magic}

\begin{quote}
	\emph{``From Star Swirl to a certain Ministry Mare of fairly ill reputation, unicorns have always been the apex of magical might! Most of us heh, have good intentions, despite uh... our impressive world record on uhm... world domination and evil. Can... can we maybe start this again? Fact is, unicorns hold a lot of power in shaping the world.''}
	
	\emph{- Lorem Ipsum, Writer, 4 BS\&R}
\end{quote}

Unicorns are known for their magic - it is as integral to their being as the horns that give them their name. Thus unicorns tend to be well-versed in a myriad of magical spells, and learn a few more innately as they test their limits through experience or learning. Of course, exceptions exist - tales of "one-trick-ponies" are as old as the dirt of Wasteland.

Unicorn magic is divided into several schools: \textbf{General}, \textbf{Conjuration}, \textbf{Dark}, \textbf{Enhancement}, \textbf{Illusion}, \textbf{Medical}, \textbf{Perception}, \textbf{Protective}, and \textbf{Transmutation}. Each school calls for a different specialization to unlock their full potential. An exception to this is the General Magic School - each unicorn learns these their own way with their own special tricks.

\textbf{Conjuration} and \textbf{Medical} magic require the unicorn to put their mind into the spells in these schools, to study them vigorously and their innate workings - in medical field this calls for anatomical knowledge and the like, while in conjuration unicorns bring matter out of the arcane.


\textbf{Enhancement} and \textbf{Illusion} magic call for unicorn's more social side to come forth. Where Illusion deals with bravado and showboating to create indistinguishable sensory foils, Enhancement directs its efforts to influence the mind almost directly.

\textbf{Dark}, \textbf{Protective}, and \textbf{Transmutation} all ask endurance from the unicorn. While Protective draws its strength of protections from the very being of the unicorn, for Transmutation it is the sheer will required to mold the matter to one's desires. Dark Magic, however, is a different beast - it is here the unicorn attempts to resist the temptations and corrupting influence of this magic when performing them.

\textbf{Perception} magic does, as one might guess, utilize the unicorn's own keen senses as basis for the magic, amplifying them further where needed.

\medskip

A magical-enhanced critter assists the caster in mundane tasks.

At one point of caster's history, she has bonded with a critter with a magical connection. The critter is a loyal companion that will never leave the caster's side, although in combat it usually hides in the caster's inventory or otherwise vanishes from the spot. It can be summoned with this spell from everywhere, and will appear through a portal to where the caster is. The critter can help their master with a myriad of tasks, including but not limited to eavesdropping, fitting into tight spaces and courier tasks.

The critter will obey its master to the best of its abilities. The critter and its master can communicate with each other, even if they wouldn't share a common language. If the master and the critter don't share interests, and if the master treats her assistant badly, there is a chance that the critter might leave its master.

If this spell is acquired at some point during a campaign, it is up to the GM where, when and how a critter assistant emerges. The type of critter that is eligible to become an assistant depends on the campaign, but generally they are small and not exotic, such as birds, rodents, dogs, cats or lizards. The size category of the critter is either -1 or -2, depending on its species.

\bigskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} The caster can use their \#1 Assistant to cast spells through them, from where the \#1 Assistant is standing on. In addition, the \#1 Assistant becomes braver with the Ascension, taking part in combat, though it cannot attack a target by itself, but it can position itself in the battlefield.

\medskip

The caster engraves a mark of arcane energy onto a target or surface, which she can use later to assist other spells.

This spell can be used to either leave a magical mark on a selected surface or activate an existing one. Magical marks can be of any design, can be either visible or invisible to the naked eye, and last up to Potency days. The original caster will always be able to see the mark. The casting of the Arcane Mark spell upon the surface where the mark is hidden will also reveal other hidden marks. The spell is rangeless after the initial casting.

The mark can also be programmed to trigger other spell effects once a predefined triggering action or set of words takes place. One must first cast Arcane Mark as well as define the trigger condition, and after that she casts the spell that will be triggered. The triggering spell is active for the duration of the Arcane Mark. The triggering effect is single use and lasts for the duration of the spell or until triggered.

The caster can have up to 4 Arcane Marks at a time.

\textbf{Note:} While Cutie Marks are a form of unique arcane mark, no magic may create an artificial Cutie Mark nor cause one to appear before its time.

\textbf{Note:} If an Arcane Mark is placed on the ground or floor (or, if GM approves, onto some other similar large solid platform), it can be used as a target for long-distance teleport.

\bigskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} The number of Arcane Marks a caster can have simultaneously rises to 6, and Arcane Mark gives +10 to Thaumaturgy when casting a spell to bind to Arcane Mark.

Afterwards, when targeting these allies with a spell with a \textit{Touch} range, there is no need to be actually touching them. Instead, if they are within the range of Bonds of Friendship, they are considered being next to the caster.

A tinted light emanates from the caster's horn, matching caster's magic. The light is powerful enough to illuminate the room, but also makes the caster an easy target in the dark.

This spell is known by all unicorns, with the exception of One Trick Pony -trait, and does not take a spot on their known spells list.

The caster's horn becomes a dazzling beacon of light, brightly illuminating an area equal to Small Splash Template around the caster. The area within is well-lit, not hampering one's visibility, and beyond that up to Huge Splash Template the light condition becomes dim light. Once activated, the spell lasts for up to an hour, but is dispelled if the caster becomes unconscious.

The caster creates a glimmering force that pushes any adjacent character back by two hexes. In addition to knocking back characters, the Mage's Bulwark gives additional DT against Melee and Unarmed weapons, including bows but not against explosives.

	\end{tblr}

\medskip

The easiest and most basic spell, Telekinesis is usually the first spell learned by a unicorn. They envelope a target with a colorful grasp, and can then physically move or manipulate the target.

This spell is known by all unicorns, with the exception of One Trick Pony -trait, and does not take a spot on their known spells list. Telekinesis is divided in two categories, Power and Precision. Power Telekinesis is the art of moving and manipulating a single heavy object, and Precision focuses on manipulating multiple small objects at once.

Upon learning the spell, the character chooses one of the two styles for which they specialize in. The style they specialize in gets full Potency in casting, and the other gets half of the Caster's Potency, to the minimum of 1 and rounded down.

When casting the spell in combat, Strain and AP cost apply only at the turn the spell is cast on. On consecutive turns the caster doesn't suffer from additional Strain or AP cost. However, if they wish to cast another spell, they have to end their Telekinesis for 0 AP cost. If they want to continue levitating objects afterwards, they need to spend the AP and Strain cost again. They can, however, mouth-operate a weapon while holding items in telekinesis without a problem. If the caster enters a Pain Threshold while levitating objects, the telekinesis ends.

When using Telekinesis to deal attacks with weapons, the weapon's skill is utilized to determine if the attack hits, for instance guns utilize Firearms. When using Improvised weapons, Thaumaturgy is used to determine if it hits. If the Thaumaturgy roll for the Improvised weapons fails, the weapon goes awry by 2 meters (1 Hex) of intended target.

Outside of combat, the spell only costs Strain, and lasts until the caster ends the spell, rests, or falls unconscious. 

\subsubsection*{Power Style:}

In Power style telekinesis, the caster can levitate an object which is the same size or larger than they are forgoing accuracy for mass. This style allows the caster to levitate themselves, without their gear interfering levitation, with 1 Strain spent per 2 meters (1 Hex) of movement. In combat, self-levitation is considered Difficult Terrain.

When levitating weapons with telekinesis, weapons with Strength Requirement of 7 or higher fall under Power Style, and can still be only lifted one at a time. Firing a weapon with this style doesn't get penalties despite the Power style being less focused on careful manipulation.

Potency determines the maximum size the caster can levitate:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	Size 2
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	Size 3
		\item[20+ Potency] 		Size 4
	\end{description}	
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{Precision Style:}

In Precision style telekinesis, the caster can levitate multiple objects, as determined by her Potency, which are smaller than the caster in size, with great accuracy.

When levitating weapons with Precision style, the weapons must have a total of 7 Strength requirement at maximum, and only two weapons can be levitated at the same time. To ready or switch between various weapons, Precision style unicorn can Ready weapon from Weapon Slots at no AP cost. 

Potency determines the maximum amount of items the caster can levitate:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	4
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	8
		\item[20+ Potency] 		12
	\end{description}	
\end{quote}

\textbf{Note:} Unicorns with \textit{One-Trick Pony} -trait gain full Potency in both styles, emphasizing their mastery of limited arsenal. Likewise, a unicorn with One Trick Pony -trait can, in Precision style, levitate up to 4 weapons simultaneously, but cannot go over the total of 7 STR requirement.

\medskip

Caster vanishes and reappears somewhere else almost instantaneously. She can take her friends with her and travel a distance in mere seconds, or use the space manipulation technique against her enemies and their items.

Strain cost is 1 per 10 meters (5 hexes) of teleporting, the maximum distance determined by Potency:
\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	20 meters
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	40 meters
		\item[20+ Potency] 		60 meters
	\end{description}
\end{quote}

The caster may choose any character or item within Tiny Splash of them to bring them through the teleport. Each additional item or character raises the Strain cost of the spell by 1.

If the caster attempts to teleport to a point they have no sight of or are not familiar* with the area they are aiming for, the caster has to roll LCK in addition to the normal Thaumaturgy roll. In case they succeed in the Thaumaturgy roll but fail the LCK roll, they do teleport but end up slightly off the mark. For instance, teleporting through a wall to the middle of a room they haven't been to may cause the caster to be somewhere else in the room, such as on a shelf, in a cabinet, or adjacent to the occupant of the room.

\medskip

*A familiar destination is a place where the caster has visited before, on one or several occasions, and spent at least an hour of her time. Areas near any of the caster's Arcane Marks placed on ground or solid platforms are always considered familiar destinations.

Especially long distance Teleport (beyond above mentioned meters determined by Potency) requires an Arcane Mark -spell, no matter the distance, to assist the caster. When teleporting to an Arcane Mark's location, the caster loses 10 Strain. Otherwise, the regular rules for Teleport apply.

A bolt of pure arcane energy damages the target.

Arcane Blast is the basic offensive spell of unicorns, where they form a singular bolt of arcane energy at the tip of their horn and shoot it at their intended target. Generally unicorns stick to one element of their choice when utilizing this spell, though exceptions exist.

Every time the caster learns this spell, she chooses one element of her choice to master:

\medskip
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Fire - Can inflict with Burning Status
	\item Ice - Can inflict with Freezing
	\item Arcane - Ignore 1 DT.
	\item Electricity - Can inflict Stunned status, and stun robots and Power Armor
\end{compactitem}
\medskip

When casting, the caster denotes what element she uses with her Arcane Blast. The AP cost for the spell is 4 and the Strain cost is 1. The attack deals magical energy damage equal to 1+(2), with additional damage added according to the caster's Potency. The caster must make a ranged attack roll with her \textbf{Thaumaturgy} skill in order to hit the target. 

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	+0 DMG die
		\item[11-20 Potency] 	+1 DMG die
		\item[20+ Potency] 	    +2 DMG die
	\end{description}	
\end{quote}

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} The caster may fire several blasts, the amount being 1+1d4 in total. Each firing of a blast costs 4 AP, but doesn't cost Strain. If the caster knows multiple elements, she may choose two elements to cast at the same time.

Bends the nearby surfaces, according to the caster's will.

The caster creates new low walls, ledges and obstacles from the materials available.

Summon a predefined object to you.

In order for this spell to function, the to-be-summoned object must be predefined. This is done by touching the object with the caster's horn, and costs no AP or Strain. After that the object can be summoned to the caster from anywhere within the range of the spell, unless it is prevented by magical means.

The cost of the spell varies depending on the size of the object to be summoned. If the object is up to Potency centimeters in its largest dimension, the spell costs 4 AP and 1 Strain. If the object is up to Potency*10 centimeters in its largest dimension, the spell costs 6 AP and 3 Strain. If the object is up to Potency meters in its largest dimension, the spell costs 10 AP and 6 Strain.

The spell lasts on the object until summoned by the caster, after which the spell must be renewed for the item to be summoned again.

\bigskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} Instead of one object, the amount of objects you can summon is determined by potency. Otherwise, the spell works normally.
\begin{quote}

Conjure a swarm of magical knives that are thrown against the target.

Caster summons a swarm of magical blades out of thin air, directing them against a single opponent which she can see. Eldritch Knives ignore the \textit{Shield-spell} entirely.

The attack with the blades is considered a Burst attack. The hail of blades deals 2+(4) in damage, with Potency determining the amount of additional dice this attack gets:

\begin{quote}

Causes a distraction with a cloud of sand.

A barrage of fine sand blows against the target's face, causing a distraction and slight discomfort.

The target of the spell gains Medium Distraction penalty to all attacks, against any target, if they fail an AGI check.

\bigskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} Caster can modify their spell with one of two effects: The spell now inflicts a Major Distraction on the target if they fail the AGI check, or the spell now affects a Small Splash Template instead of 1 target, but with Minor Distraction.

\medskip

Creates a magic moldable shield of magical energy that protects against bullets and similar projectile attacks and Magic Energy Weapons. The shield is thin, transparent and matches the color of caster's magic.

Shield can be wrapped around any target area within Potency*2 meters of the caster, covering maximum of 6 meters in its largest dimension. The caster chooses upon casting the spell whether the shield's position is fixed (doesn't move) or in relation to the caster (for example, always in front of the caster). Creatures and objects can go through Shield, but damaging projectiles interfere with it.

Shield has a DT determined by caster's Potency, and 5 HP tokens. The DT from Shield stacks with worn equipment, the exact amount determined by Potency as follows:
\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	1 DT
		\item[10-19 Potency]    2 DT
		\item[20+ Potency] 		3 DT
	\end{description}
\end{quote}

Attacks that deal more damage than the combined DT value damage the shield first. When the Shield's HP is reduced to 0, the spell ends, and the excess HP loss is dealt normally. The spell works both ways; attacks made from both sides of Shield are affected. Caster can manifest only one Shield at a time, but she can use other spells while Shield is active.

\bigskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} The Shield's HP is 10, and having it active gives a minor boost to the aiming of the next spell, giving +5 to Thaumaturgy to any character inside the Shield. This boost is then spent, and doesn't apply to any additional spell casting, even if the shield is active.

\medskip

Summons a small storm cloud that ravages the area.

A small yet volatile storm cloud forms on the point the spell is casted at, having a mind of its own afterwards.

The cloud travels a maximum of 10 meters (5 hexes) towards the nearest creature, ally or foe, and once above a target, then discharges lightning bolts on all targets on a Tiny Splash template. Characters within a Small Splash template of the cloud get a Minor distraction from the lightning bolts. The damage is determined by potency as follows:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	3+(1) dmg
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	4+(2) dmg
		\item[20+ Potency] 		6+(3) dmg
	\end{description}	
\end{quote}

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} The spell's Splash Template is Small Splash instead of Tiny, and the spell can cause 1 target within the area to become Stunned. The target gets an Opposed roll of Caster's INT versus the target's END.

The caster conjures a thick copper-colored fog around a target in a Tiny Splash Template. Creatures outside of the Tiny Splash Template have a visibility penalty determined by the caster's Potency, while the target of the spell suffers no such penalty. If any other character moves inside the Spell's area of effect, they still suffer the visibility penalty, as if they were outside of it. The Wall of Mist moves with the target, tethered to them with arcane energy.

The caster's Potency determines the penalty as follows:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	-5
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	-10

\textbf{Ascended spell:} The Area of Effect of this spell increases to Small Splash, and upon learning this Ascended spell the caster may choose one of the following elements to apply to the mist:

\smallskip

\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{Fire:} Burning heat engulfs the mist - any entities passing through the area may gain Burning -status effect.
	\item \textbf{Ice:} Darts of ice swirl within the mist - any entities passing through the area may gain Freezing -status effect.
	\item \textbf{Arcane:} Arcane radiation glows in the mist - anyone standing or passing through the area are inflicted with 2x40\% Rads.
	\item \textbf{Electricity:} Electricity crackles within the mist - any entities passing through the area may gain Stunned -status effect.

\medskip

Caster conjures ominous blood weapons out of the corpses of the fallen or herself.

This spell requires either a fresh corpse (dead for less than 2 hours) or health (HP) to function. Only corpses of creatures that depend on blood can be used. Upon casting this spell, the caster must decide what kind of weapons she conjures (knife, fire axe, etc.). Only melee or unarmed weapons can be conjured.

Spell conjures a number of determined weapons up to a maximum of 4. One corpse of a size 0 pony can produce up to 2 weapons, and in order to conjure more than that, more corpses are required. If no suitable corpses lay around, the caster may use her own life force to conjure weapons. For each weapon she conjures this way she loses 1 HP. The caster cannot kill herself upon casting this spell as once the caster's HP drops to a Pain Threshold, no weapons can be conjured.

Conjured weapons float in the air near the caster by default. The caster must command them to attack or move away from her. Commanding these weapons is equal to the AP cost of the weapon in question, and Thaumaturgy roll is required to hit with the weapons. If not commanded, the weapon floats idly and do nothing. The weapons deal damage equal to their normal counterparts, but are destroyed if they are dropped by the caster after a Called Shot against said weapons.

This spell has 50\% chance to inflict 1 Insanity on the caster.

\bigskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} In addition to dealing damage, the weapons have a chance of causing a Minor Distraction when they hit a target. An Opposed END roll is required to see if the target of a Blood Weapon becomes distracted when successfully attacked. The caster can also make a shield out of the blood she uses, with the shield blocking 2 DT. A disarming Called Shot can destroy this shield. The shield is attached to the caster's leg and thus it cannot be used to fire a weapon.

Devours all light from the area, turning the place into darkness.

Upon casting Devouring Darkness, all light sources within the spell's radius are quenched. Any natural light disappears and the area becomes pitch black. To the outside the area looks very dark, like a strong shadow, and figures and other features are still visible, meaning that characters outside of the area of effect are not affected by the visibility penalty. To those inside the area the place becomes totally dark and they can barely see anything, resulting in the Visibility -40 penalty to hitting any targets, including adjacent ones.

In addition, upon casting the spell all creatures inside its Area of Effect lose 1 HP. DT, neither from armor or natural doesn't protect from this HP loss.

This spell has 30\% chance to inflict 1 Insanity on the caster.

\bigskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} Creatures outside of the spell, aside from caster, suffer a -10 Visibility Penalty when trying to hit targets inside the spell's area of effect. Creatures inside the spell take 2 HP damage and 1 Insanity upon casting.

Fear is a nasty spell of the mind; it shows the target their deepest fears, leaving the target in a trance to watch their worst nightmare unfold, after which they come back from the brink a little worse for wear. Only the target can see the dark illusion. The spell automatically detects target's fears and works according to them.

Upon a successful casting, the caster rolls a 1d100, adds her Potency to the roll and refers to the table below:

Forces the target's heart to stop.

The target of the spell suffers a heart attack - effectively stopping their heart on the spot.

If the casting of the spell is successful, the target rolls for END with a penalty to their roll being determined by the caster's Potency. If successful, the target recovers but suffers Medium Distraction penalties for 3 rounds.

\begin{quote}

	\end{description}
\end{quote}

If a failure, the target falls unconscious and is considered dying, perishing within 3 rounds unless successfully treated with a Hard Medicine-skill check or with a spell from the Medicine- magic school. If a character is successfully healed, they will have as much HP tokens as they had prior to the Heart Attack spell. However, the character will have Minor Distraction penalty for 3 rounds.

This spell inflicts 1 Insanity on the caster.

Take the life force of another for yourself.

The magic aura of the caster envelopes the target briefly, leeching the life force from the latter to the former.

The caster deals damage to the target equal to 1 + (2) and regains HP equal to HP loss inflicted. Target's DT applies, and excess HP healed is not stored. Potency determines additional damage dealt, as follows:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	+0 Die
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	+1 Dice
		\item[20+ Potency] 		+1 Base, +1 Dice

\end{quote}

If the target would go to or below 0 HP due the spell, they fall unconscious at 1 HP for 5 rounds and cannot be the target of Life Surge until healed.

This spell has a 70\% chance to inflict Insanity on the caster.

Caster becomes a cloud of dark fog, allowing her to move more freely and be immune to mundane attacks. 	

Spell transforms the caster into a dark cloud of smoke. While the spell is active, she is able to slip through small cracks and crevasses with ease, or enlarge herself to fill the entire room to intimidate creatures. The spell costs 5 AP and 3 Strain, and can be canceled at will.

While in Shadow Form, the caster moves double her normal speed. She is immune to physical damage, but MEWs, spells and other magical damage deal damage normally. Caster cannot use any items while in this form, but may cast spells. If intimidating or frightening a foe while in this form, she adds her Potency to the roll as a bonus.

The caster can inhabit the same space as another character, and any character in the same space as Caster will start to suffocate, losing 2 HP each turn. If the character goes to 0 HP due to this HP loss, they will go unconscious from lack of air.

In combat, the caster can enlarge themselves to cover an area equal to Large Splash Template. In this size, they will not cause targets to suffocate due to their form not being condensed enough. Likewise, enemies gain a +10 to hit them.

Taking the form is physically and mentally taxing on the caster. Upon casting and every minute thereafter, the caster has a 50\% chance to gain 1 Insanity.

\medskip

The act of placing a piece of one's soul into an object to obtain immortality -in a sense- rendering the object in question to be nearly impervious to damage. However, the process is beyond painful and could render a person mad.

The caster chooses an object into which she transfers her, or another being's mind and soul. Casting Soul Jar is a long, 8 hour process that requires immense concentration and must be done uninterrupted. As such, it cannot be casted during combat. Soul Jar has no AP cost, but it costs 3 Strain per hour, or 24 Strain in total. If the caster is in any way interrupted during casting, the spell fails. 

This spell's costs can be divided by assisting casters that have this spell, but the brunt of the Strain cost is always on the initial caster. Likewise, the effect of this spell doesn't apply to the assisting casters.

If the spell succeeds, caster's soul fragments and part of the soul inhabits the item in question, thus acting as a vessel for the caster to ''live'' in after her body perishes.

The caster has no control over the item before or after her perishing, but they can express themselves if the item in question is capable of producing sound, image or text. A book used as a soul jar might have text appearing into it from thin air, and a megaphone might start talking by itself. Though they cannot move by themselves, they can still cast spells, though with a -30 penalty to Thaumaturgy if they cannot produce a sound with which to verbally cast a spell.

The caster becomes basically immortal, although destroying the container of her soul with powerful magic will immediately kill her. If the destroyer's Potency is greater than the caster's Potency (who originally cast Soul Jar), the soul container is destroyed and the soul goes with it. If the Potencies of the destroyer and the original caster are equal, there is a 50\% chance of the container being destroyed.

The caster can at a later date transfer her soul into a receptive and willing body. This requires casting Soul Jar again, targeting the new host.

This spell inflicts 1 Insanity on the caster. Assisting casters have a 50\% chance being inflicted with 1 Insanity.

\medskip

These ominous crystals nullify all magic in the worst of ways, leaving unicorns and Earth ponies magicless and pegasi and griffins grounded and unable to control clouds. It is unknown if the crystals grow larger over time.

The caster causes dark crystals to sprout from another unicorn's horn, earth pony's legs, or a pegasus'/griffin's wings like strange crystal growths. Attempts to use magic or wings leads to a jolt of pain, as well as there being a constant feeling of something integral missing.

Each time a victim of Vile Crystal attempts to use magic or fly, she must succeed on an opposed END roll to maintain focus through the pain. Outside of combat, she has to succeed in an END roll to be able to use their innate abilities. If the roll is successful, she can cast a spell or fly on that round or for 10 minutes outside of combat. Despite the result of the roll, she must spend the appropriate cost for that action, as well as take 1 HP of damage that ignores DT.

The spell can be targeted to a creature or to an area. If targeted on a single creature, it costs 8 AP and 2 Strain. If targeted on an area, it costs 12 AP and 6 Strain. When casting on an area, the targets affected can roll END-2 to resist the spell's effect. This END-2 roll happens each round characters remain or pass through the affected area.

The spell's effects are permanent unless healed through the use of Clean-spell.

This spell has 60\% chance to inflict 1 Insanity on the caster.

\medskip

Enchants a weapon to ignore designated targets.

Upon casting Bypass on a weapon, the caster determines the spell's precise functionality. In other words, caster tells the weapon which targets to ignore. For example, the caster may enchant a weapon to ignore an ally. Only one specific type can be selected. There are several types of ignorable targets: characters by race, age or size, by alignment (ally, friendly, hostile), objects by type, material or size, walls of type or material, and so on. The GM determines if the enchantment is valid.

The effect can be removed prematurely by destroying the weapon or with Failsafe-spell. Only one Bypass can be active on a weapon at a time.

\medskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} You may choose two target types for the weapon to bypass instead of one. Likewise, the AP cost of the spell is now 6.

Magically make suggestions and alter the behavior of a creature.

Spell allows the caster to influence another creature, giving it commands that will alter its behavior. Controlling other beings is difficult, and as such the caster must state her intentions (verbally or with body language) with as few words as possible, preferably short and to-the-point sentences or movements.

Upon casting the spell, the target may make a CHA or INT roll against the spell's effect. The penalty to the roll is determined by the caster's Potency, and in combat the penalties are halved:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	-10 penalty
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	-20 penalty
		\item[20+ Potency] 	-30 penalty
	\end{description}
\end{quote}

If the target fails, she enters a state of inactivity, staring forward blankly unless a command is given. If the command is simple or non-hazardous, the command is carried out without a problem (for example, opening a door). If the command is complex or dangerous to the target, she may roll to resist the spell again twice, and take the better result. In addition, if the target becomes threatened or shocked, it gains a new resist roll to shake off the effects of the spell.

The target will perform the desired command to the letter (for example, if ordered to open door, the target will open the door once). The maximum duration of the spell is Potency minutes, during which the caster may issue new commands without casting the spell again.

\textbf{Note:} This spell has no effect on mindless targets, such as robots or plants.

\textbf{Note:} This spell is countered with Calm Mind.

\bigskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} The caster may now give the target of Compulsion more complex commands, such as multi-stage instructions.

\medskip

Cause discord and friction between targets.

The spell changes each target's mood and attitude towards negative. Loving becomes indifferent, indifferent become quarrelsome, and quarrelsome become hostile.

Targets may make a CHA or INT roll with a penalty to resist the spell. If the spell is successful, the targets react to each other more negatively. Also, targets have 20\% chance to gain 1 Insanity if the spell is successful. The exact penalty is determined by the caster's Potency: 

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	-10 penalty to roll
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	-20 penalty to roll
		\item[20+ Potency] 	-30 penalty to roll
	\end{description}
\end{quote}

This spell can be used to lower NPC Disposition by 1 per casting. It can also be made to influence targets' mood towards a particular individual more negative.

\textbf{Note:} Mindless creatures and robots are immune to the effects of this spell.

\bigskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} The chance to cause Insanity onto the targets is doubled, likewise, the AP cost is lowered to 7. Strain cost of the spell is 3.

\medskip

Clears the caster's mind, providing a one-time bonus for the next spell cast.

The caster puts aside any distraction, putting all her concentration on the next spell she will cast.

After the caster has entered her trance, she can choose to do one of the following with the next spell:
\medskip
\begin{compactitem}
	\item The next spell costs 2 Strain less (minimum of 1).
	\item The spell's Area of Effect is one category larger, to a maximum of Huge Splash.
	\item Opposed Rolls gain +10 to caster's benefit.
	\item The spell's range has additional 4 meters (2 hex) in length.
\end{compactitem}
\medskip

However, if the caster receives any damage between the castings of Magic Trance and the next spell, she must succeed a Thaumaturgy check to maintain concentration. On a failure, the trance breaks, any bonus chosen is lost, and the caster's head has a 20\% chance of being Crippled from the magical backlash.

Protects an item from wearing and tearing.

Magically enchants an item to survive the test of time. It protects the item from age-related wearing and tearing or decay. Item with this spell cast on it, will not lower their Item Condition from environmental effects, including Taint or Pink Cloud.  However, the item condition can drop if actively harmed. Likewise, items enchanted with this spell will not melt and fuse to their target when exposed to Pink Cloud or Taint.

The caster's appealing and positive traits seem more pronounced, while character's less pleasant qualities seem to be more trivial. The spell adds a bonus of 5 + Potency to Barter and Diplomacy checks, and improves NPC disposition by one step. Spell costs 3 AP and 3 Strain.

Common version of the spell affects only the caster. One may instead affect up to 4 other creatures, which then all benefit from the spell. However, this increases the spell's AP and Strain costs by 2.

Forces an object to stay on its original position on the time of the casting.

Any object or creature affected by the spell stays on the position it was at at the time of casting and cannot be moved - not by brute force or telekinesis. 

The target's bodily functions work as normal, allowing them to breathe and perceive their surroundings as much as they're able to without being able to move their heads. The objects can be moved once more when the spell ends, the caster ends the spell, or when Failsafe is successfully cast.

The target under the effects of this spell can attempt to break out of the spell once per round, with a -2 STR or -2 END roll. Breaking out of the spell does not spend AP or Strain.

Disguise an area to resemble another, for example a field into a thick, scary forest or a desolate ruin into a garden. The general shape of the terrain remains the same, even when the details change. The spell cannot disguise creatures.

This spell can be used to create a Difficult Terrain where there is none or hide treacherous spots where they are, and the size of the area is determined by the caster's Potency as follows:

\medskip

Create a powerful, lifelike illusion of almost anything alive.

The spell allows the caster to create a particularly accurate illusion of a creature, both sentient and not. The duplicate can only take form of something the caster has encountered or seen before. The illusion is, unlike most illusions, a solid creature.

The illusion obeys the caster without question and possesses no will of its own, nor is it capable of speech. The caster can cast spells through the illusion, as long as they are within a Large Splash Template of it. Other creatures can make an Opposed CHA roll against the caster's CHA to see through the illusion.

Illusions made by the spell can be used to deal damage. The illusion may either move 6 meters/ 3 hexes or attack on its own once per turn at no AP cost for the caster, dealing either damage or a status effect of the caster's choice to a single target. The damage is determined by the caster's Potency. However, the damage the duplicate deals is always non-lethal and if they manage to get their target to 0 HP, the target falls unconscious but isn't dying. The illusion's attacks are magical in nature.

The illusion's DT, damage and status effects it can cause depend on the caster's potency as follows:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency]    0 DT, 1+(2) damage, Encumbered
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	1 DT, 2+(2) damage, Blinded or Encumbered
		\item[20+ Potency] 		2 DT, 3+(2) damage, Bleeding, Blinded or Encumbered
	\end{description}	
\end{quote}

The illusionary duplicate has 10 HP, and once it's HP goes to 0, the illusion disappears into thin air, leaving behind only debris. Likewise, the illusion will disappear if the spell's duration runs out.

Series of random words spoken from a point designated by caster, also volume.

The caster forms a little bubble and throws it to the targeted area, where it will spray out few words - distracting others with a Minor Distraction. If the caster has \textit{One Trick Pony -trait} with this spell selected, they cause Medium Distraction instead.

The spell affects anyone within Large Splash of the targeted area, provided they are not engaged in combat. If they are engaged in combat, they have an opposed roll PER versus the caster's CHA. If they successfully win the opposed roll, they ignore the effect of this spell.

This spell can be used to confuse others and direct their focus elsewhere outside of combat.

Caster conjures a ball of anesthetic magical energy. When the energy ball hits a target, it falls immediately into a deep slumber.

The caster must make a Medicine check. If successful, the magical energy will touch the patient correctly, and she loses her sense of touch and pain. This also results in a loss of associated motor capabilities, effectively paralyzing the patient. Duration is Potency minutes on a willing or unconscious subject. During the spell's effect, the patient can be healed more efficiently, as she won't panic or tremble. Medicine checks against an anesthetized target gain a bonus of 20 and heal double the normal amount.

The spell can also be used offensively. In such cases, the target makes an END opposed roll against the caster (INT) to resist the spell. The spell causes Stunned status effect on an unwilling target, and the target suffers a Minor Distraction for Potency rounds. Conventional protective items such as armor won't save the target from the spell.

\textbf{Note:} Creatures immune to sleep and mind-affecting effects are immune to this spell.

\bigskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} When used offensively, the target suffers a penalty of -2 to their END roll to resist. In addition, the target will suffer from Medium Distraction instead of Minor Distraction for the duration of the spell.

Restores broken bones and crippled limbs.

Caster may concentrate on her target in order to restore their bones and crippled limbs. The spell requires a successful Thaumaturgy roll in order to work properly.

Upon casting on a target, the spell removes one Crippled condition from any limb.

If the targeted limb is severed, the Strain cost is increased by 4, attaching the limb and curing the Crippled condition at the end of the spell.

The number of characters the caster can Bone Mend with one casting is determined by their Potency:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}

Alleviates mental pain and panic, as well as negates effects of Fear- and Mind Probe- spells.

This spell calms the person from a panic attack or worst fears, as well as actively negating harmful spells and conditions that target a person's mind. If cast on a character currently under effects of Fear, Mind Probe, Panic, Mind-control or other similar mind-altering effect, the spell immediately cancels the hindering spell or effect. However, the target will suffer from Minor Distraction from the sudden change for 1 rounds.

\bigskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} When casting the spell, the caster can decide if they cast the spell normally, or as a Large Splash Template centered on caster. When cast as AoE, this spell affects any who are within the Splash Template. In addition, the targets of this spell may roll END to resist the Minor Distraction.

Cleanses toxins and removes radiation.

The spell removes toxins from the target's system and cures diseases. On a successful Thaumaturgy roll, it removes effects of poisons from the target and removes Rads equal to the caster's INT/2. The spell can also be used to clean matter or an area, upon which the radiation removal happens to the area and not to the critters inside it.
The spell costs 4 AP and 2 Strain.

If used to clean an area, the size is dependent on the caster's Potency:

Boosts the SPECIAL stats of the target

The target of the spell has her physical or mental capabilities boosted for a period of time.

The caster chooses one SPECIAL stat to boost, excluding LCK. Said stat gains a bonus of 2 for Potency minutes. A target may benefit from only one SPECIAL bonus from Enhancement at a time.

Outside of combat, this spell can be used to heal SPECIAL damage, with caster's Potency determining the maximum amount of healed SPECIAL penalties. Permanently healing a target adds +3 to Strain cost. Multiple SPECIALs can be healed simultaneously, such as healing 1 point of STR damage, and 2 points of AGI damage. Critical success on Thaumaturgy roll allows 1 additional point of SPECIAL damage to be healed.

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}

\textbf{Note:} SPECIAL loss from Sleep Deprivation, Hunger and Thirst, or Rads are not affected by this spell.

A spell to cure ailments and ills, for at least a little while...

The target of the spell will not suffer from withdrawal effects of drugs and alcohol for the duration of the spell. The spell does not, however, completely remove withdrawal from drugs, only alleviates the withdrawal effects for a short period.

Likewise, the spell can be used to give 1 target additional bonus against physical status effects for the duration of this spell, the bonus being determined by the caster's Potency:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}

The target's frail mind is sewed back together.

Upon casting the spell, the target may recover from Insanity she has suffered. The caster has to succeed in a Hard Medicine check to remove Insanity from the target, and gains a bonus equal to her Potency to the roll. The amount of Insanity the caster can remove depends on their Potency:

Raise the sensitivity of the target's senses, or make them more perceptible by others.

The spell can be utilized in two ways: either increasing the sensitivity of one of the senses of the target (sight, sound, taste, smell, or touch) or allow others to perceive them better by one of the listed senses. At the casting of the spell, the caster chooses one sense she wants to Amplify, and in which way. The spell affects up to 4 targets and they may make an END opposed roll against the caster's CHA to resist the effects.

If used to boost a sense of the target, the target gains a bonus to their PER rolls according to the caster's Potency when using that sense.

If used to boost a source of sensory stimulus, such as voice, everyone gains a bonus to their PER rolls according to the caster's Potency when they're using that sense to perceive the target.

The spell can also have a secondary effect. For example, if the caster chooses to boost her own sound, she might gain a bonus to her Intimidation check determined by her Potency, or any other roll that is found suitable as follows:

\begin{quote}

Makes a mirror to reflect a vision from a predetermined place the caster has been to.

The caster conjures a little mirror on the spot she's standing, and by using the conjured mirror, she can see into places she has visited before. However, to be able to gaze upon the location, the place must have a reflective surface in it; specific size not required.

Once a mirror has been conjured, it will be tangible and can be carried in inventory. The mirror disappears after Potency hours or when a new mirror is conjured. Only the caster can use the mirror with the intended purpose, to others it looks and acts like a regular mirror. \textit{Detection-spell} reveals the true nature of the mirror as a magically created item.

Allows the caster to implant, copy or remove memories of another.

This spells allows the caster to extract a memory from the target. The target must be willing or unconscious, and the caster must touch the forehead of the target the entire duration of the spell. During the spell, both the target and the caster will be incapable of perceiving their surroundings.

Finding and viewing the target's memories doesn't require additional rolls or actions, but the target is allowed to resist with a CHA or INT roll when their memories are being actively tampered with. The caster may remove or copy the target's specific memories but Memory Manipulation cannot be used to make new or fake memories. Additionally, the caster's own memories or ones from memory orbs can be shown to the target with this spell.

When removing a memory, it disappears completely from the target's head, and recovering it is nigh impossible. When copying a memory, an appropriate vessel is required to house the memory. If no vessel is provided, the memory will be stored amongst the caster's own with 10\% chance of Insanity. Appropriate vessels are gems and empty memory orbs.

The target's resistance roll is modified by the caster's Potency as follows:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	-10 penalty to roll
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	-20 penalty to roll
		\item[20+ Potency] 	-30 penalty to roll

Gazes into the thoughts and feelings of the target, possibly learning new information.

However, to gain this information between two targets they have to stand within the range of the spell from each other. On top of that, the caster must be able to see the line in question to decipher the connection.

Share thoughts and senses with others.

The caster and any target she chooses to cast this spell with share a link of thoughts, able to communicate with just their mind.

The spell does not give the caster an access to the target(s) memories and knowledge - only current thoughts are transferred between any and all under the effect of the spell.

\bigskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} The number of targets the caster can use telepathy with grows to a maximum of 8, the AP cost of the spell becomes 3.

Designates an area that triggers when a threatening force enters it.

The spell marks a specific area which alerts the caster to the presence of a threatening entity when it enters or passes through the area. If the caster is awake, she immediately recognizes that the spell has triggered. If she is sleeping, she must succeed in a PER check, negating any penalties from the sleep. Only one area can be under the effect of this spell, a new casting replaces the old one.

Grants protection against elemental damage.

This spell creates a protective layer around the target(s), protecting them against elemental harm. Upon casting, the caster chooses one type of energy from the following: cold, electricity or fire. The spell adds a bonus of 20 to SPECIAL rolls to resist Status effects from that element.

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} The target gains additional 1 DT against the element in addition to the +20 to resist the status-effects. When hit by an elemental attack, the target may decide to ignore the additional 1 DT from this spell and instead cause 1 HP elemental damage of the same type to go back to the source of damage. This 1 dmg ignores DT and is magical in nature.

The element bouncing can only be done once per turn.

Grants protection against environmental hazards.

This spell creates a protective aura on the caster that protects against common environmental hazards, such as heat or cold.

Those affected by the spell are immune to non-damaging effects such as rain and mild frostbite. Against damaging long-term effects, such as severe frostbite, extreme heat, or electrical currents, the spell grants a bonus of 1 to END. It does not grant protection against uncommon hazards, such as radiation, Taint or Pink Cloud.

Dispels magical effects.

All magical effects in the targeted area are temporarily suppressed on a successful Thaumaturgy roll for 5 rounds. All magical abilities, such as Aerial Maneuvers, Alchemy, or Spirit Magic, cannot be used in the target area. The affected area is determined by the caster's Potency:

\begin{quote}

A wasteland critter comes to the caster's aid

The caster has a bond with the surrounding wilds, able to call help from it by concentrating. However, the caster cannot directly determine what kind of critter will come to her aid.

Upon casting the spell, the GM allows one monster from the Monster Manual or his own creation to join the caster's side, which then follows simple commands of the caster for the duration of the spell. If the creature is still present after the effect of the spell ends, it resumes its normal routines - it may walk off or turn hostile, for instance. This spell can summon sentient creatures, by compelling them to help you, even if they normally would not. 

If the caster has the \textit{Fluttershy's Apostle -perk}, the non-sentient creatures that appear with the use of this spell will not turn hostile unless injured. Likewise, non-sentients summoned with this spell do not adhere to the restrictions of the beforementioned perk.

Note: Robots and plants do not heed the call of the caster.

Protects against mental probing and mind-affecting effects.

This spell creates a mental barrier that protects the target against mental probing and mind affecting effects. If the target ends up under hostile mind attack (such as illusions or Memory Manipulation), the attacker must roll twice and take the worse result. If the target would be mentally affected by a status effect such as Dazed, Enraged or Mind-Controlled, she may roll twice and take the better result.

If the character under the effect of this Spell is about to get an Insanity point, they can roll twice to resist. However, they have to take the second roll.

The spell doesn't work on effects that are already active upon casting of Mental Bulwark.

An inanimate object is granted life.

Caster touches an inanimate object with her horn; the inanimate object will gain life for the duration of the spell. Upon casting, the caster must make a successful INT roll if she wishes to command the animated object. If the roll fails, the object has a mind of its own and won't directly obey anyone's orders.

The size of the object determines the cost and difficulty of the spell. Size category -2 or smaller items cost 6 AP and 1 Strain, and incur no penalty. Every size category greater than those add 2 AP and 1 Strain to the cost, and cumulative -10 penalty to the INT roll.

\medskip

\begin{tblr}

	Size +3 or bigger  		&  	16 AP, 6 Strain, -50 Penalty to INT roll 		\\ \hline
\end{tblr}

\medskip

The complexity of the object also affects the cost of the spell. Simple objects, that would be capable of performing one or two simple activities, such as chairs or books, add no additional cost to the spell. More complex objects that are capable of more simple functions or functions that would aid the caster in combat, such as carts or melee weapons, add 1 additional Strain to the cost of the spell. Very complex items, such as firearms or model robots, add 2 additional Strain to the cost of the spell.

NOTE: There is no upper limit on how many objects a caster can animate, but she is only able to control 4 objects directly and accurately.

NOTE: Attended objects, such as enemy's weapon, can be animated but if the caster fails their INT roll, the owner of the item automatically gains control of the animated item.

%NOTE: Attended objects (such as enemy's weapon) can be animated, but the caster must make an opposed roll against object owner's AGI. If the spell is successful, but the caster fails her INT roll, the original owner of the item may make a INT roll to gain control over the item.

\bigskip

\textbf{Ascended Spell:} The caster can reroll their INT roll when trying to gain command of the object, but the second roll stays in effect. In addition, the caster has a +10 to Diplomacy, Barter and Intimidation rolls if the INT roll was unsuccessful, for the purpose of asking the independent animated object to do specific things.

Causes seeds to sprout, or causes a living plant to physically mature rapidly.

The spell has three difficulty levels: light, medium and strong. Stronger versions affect a larger area and number of targets at the cost more time and Strain.

\textbf{Light version} causes Potency days' worth of growth. It affects up to 30 seeds or 3 plants. Spell costs 3 AP and 1 Strain.

\textbf{Medium version} causes Potency weeks' worth of growth. It affects up to 300 seeds or 30 plants. Spell costs 6 AP and 3 Strain.

\textbf{Strong version} causes Potency months' worth of growth. Otherwise it works like the medium version. Spell costs 9 AP and 5 Strain.

In addition to being turned to stone, the target gains DT against damage from firearms, MEWs, Unarmed or bladed Melee weapons according to her Potency.

The caster becomes phased between two dimensions, making them intangible.

Upon casting Phase, the caster phases out of the current dimension with only a faint outline of them being left behind. They are able to step through solid objects for the duration of the spell, and they only take damage from magical attacks, such as Arcane Blast and MEWs.

This spell does not turn the caster invisible, but they become ethereal, which gives them a bonus of +10 on Sneak.

Magically revert an object to its original condition.

The spell requires that at least 50\% of the targeted object is still there in order to function. In order to repair an item, the caster must succeed on a Mechanics skill roll (or some other appropriate skill roll), and she gains a bonus to her roll equal to her Potency*2. Success immediately repairs all damage done to the object and reverts it to its original, good condition. Missing pieces will reappear, broken parts will mend themselves, and worn materials become whole.

The mending happens instantaneously and the effect is permanent, but future damage and wear affect the item normally. This spell cannot target living matter.

The base cost of the spell is 4 AP and 1 Strain, when used in combat. The condition of the object adds to the cost of the spell as follows:
\medskip
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Relatively new but broken: no additional cost.
	\item A lot of wear and a few bullet holes: 2 AP and 1 Strain.

Forms a tangible object from your magic for a limited time.

The caster creates a semitransparent object from her own magic, which she can then utilize as she needs. Summoning this object costs 3 AP and 1 Strain.

The caster can have up to 4 different mundane objects simultaneously conjured by Shape Magic. Because of their arcane nature, the objects do not create sounds when hitting normal objects.

\textbf{Note:} Objects created by Shape Magic are considered Improvised Weapons if used in combat. Damage and AP cost depends on the size of the conjured object. These improvised weapons use either melee or unarmed.

Steady Walk allows the target of the spell not only to walk on clouds and other non-tangible surfaces such as water and smoke, but to touch and interact with them as well. It lets the target use cloud technology, even if she's not a pegasus or a griffin. The spell costs 4 AP and 1 Strain.

The spell can be utilized to dispel another \textit{Transformation} spell, in order to return the target to their original form. Likewise, a \textit{Failsafe}-spell can remove the spell's effects on a target.

	\emph{``Ponies sing to harmony while seeking to control every aspect of life, death, nature all; from tiniest cloud to how autumn leaves fall! By contrast, true partnership we shamans want, we treat the world as kin, companion and as our confidant. We strike a deal with gifts aplenty, with spirits both big and small, so that they'll heed our call.''}

Spirit Magic dwells into the realm of otherwordly beings - either those that have walked on the Wasteland before, or timeless powers from a bygone era. 

Spirit Magic is divided into sections as defined by the spirit's domain: \textbf{Embers}, \textbf{Machines}, \textbf{Nature}, \textbf{Serenity}, \textbf{Shadows}, \textbf{Streams}, \textbf{Trust}, and \textbf{Whispers}, each favoring a particular attribute in their shamans. In addition to these there are \textbf{Incantations} - little tricks that those utilizing Spirit Magic can harness from the lesser spirits that linger around us.

The caster cleanses impurities and ailments from a single target or area by touching with their hoof. 

She can remove Rads from a target, as remove any poisons or physical status effects from the character, as well as the effect of Vile Crystals -spell. 

This spell can also be used to momentarily cleanse an area around the caster, with the size of the area depending on the caster's Potency. The caster must touch the ground with their hoof in order for the spell to channel through. 
This spell can momentarily remove Taint, Radiation, poisons and Pink Cloud from the environment, but cannot affect temperature. The duration for which the negative effects are removed depend on Potency of the caster.

\newpage

Area of Effect and duration on environmental dangers are dependent on Potency:

The caster conjures up a slightly grim-looking ghostly lantern filled with a pale blue light. This light from the lantern is only visible to the caster and their allies, and invisible to others. The lantern hovers in air, about shoulder height of a regular pony, and moves according to the caster.

The Phantom Lantern illuminates dark areas as if they were in bright daylight, removing visibility penalties from a Large Splash Template, which is centered on caster.

\medskip

The shaman draws forth any nearby helpful lesser spirit, and directs their assistance towards their ally, giving one of the following boons. The following list are instant effects, curing the associated penalties:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Heal a physical status effect, such as Bleeding.
	\item Help an Unconscious ally back on their feet.
	\item Ally has SPECIAL damage healed.
	\item Ally has HP damage healed.
\end{itemize}

The amount of SPECIAL and HP damage healed depends on the caster's Potency as follows:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	1 point
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	2 points
		\item[20+ Potency] 	    4 points

\end{quote}

The following boons have a duration, and their penalties will return once the spell ends:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ally can ignore one Crippled-condition for the duration of the spell.
	\item Ally can ignore one Pain Threshold penalty for the duration of the spell.

The shaman summons a minor spirit and directs their harmful energy in the direction of their choosing. This spear-like, nearly invisible projectile moves in a straight line, injuring anyone in its path. The projectile deals 2+(2) damage to each target it hits. DT applies normally.

The furthest the Spirit Spear can reach relies on the caster's Potency as follows:
\begin{quote}

Nearby spirits convey thoughts and senses with others the caster chooses with, serving as a link between minds.

The caster and any target she chooses to cast this spell with share a link of thoughts, able to communicate with just their mind.

The spell does not give the caster an access to the target(s) memories and knowledge - only current thoughts are transferred between any and all under the effect of the spell.

\medskip

The shaman collects nearby spirits to form a thick, grayish fog around a target in a Tiny Splash Template. Creatures outside of the Tiny Splash Template have a visibility penalty determined by the caster's Potency, while the target of the spell suffers no such penalty. If any other character moves inside the Spell's area of effect, they still suffer the visibility penalty, as if they were outside of it. The Wall of Mist moves with the target, tethered to them with arcane energy.

The caster's Potency determines the penalty as follows:

\begin{quote}

\medskip

The shaman summons one of the dreaded, albeit lesser, Windigos for a brief moment to enchant a weapon with icy energy, allowing that weapon to do magical cold damage for a short period of time. If the item in question already causes cold damage, this spell adds dice to the damage according to the caster's Potency:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	+(1)
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	+(2)
		\item[20+ Potency] 	    +(3)
	\end{description}
\end{quote}

After the spell ends, the enchantment disappears. This spell isn't cumulative in its effect, and recasting it on a weapon with Windigo's Favor already active will automatically fail.

The Spirit of Embers envelops the caster in a ghostly fire, burning anyone who comes near with the radiating heat, while leaving the caster unharmed.

The damage is determined by the caster's potency:

\end{quote}

This spell ignores DT, and can apply the Burning-status effect on anyone passing through the affected area with a -1 END to the resistance-roll.

Creatures that are immune to fire damage take no damage from this spell, and creatures that heal from fire, also heal from the effects of this spell.

The caster conjures up a burning wheel within the range of the spell, that she can control at-will. The wheel can move on the battlefield as the caster wishes, for a maximum of 6 hexes per turn. Commanding the wheel does not spend AP or Strain. 

Any characters this wheel rams into must make an Opposed roll of caster's AGI versus the target's END to see if they fall prone and are burnt by the wheel. If the caster wins, the target takes Fire damage according to the caster's Potency and suffers a Burning status effect.

A cluster of scrap gets drawn forth by the spirit, from the surroundings or from the ground, to block off an area. The cluster acts as a Total Cover (-30 Attack penalty), and fully occupies the area. Any creature on affected area has to succeed in AGI roll to move to any nearby free space or become Pinned on the affected area. 

The barrier's size is equal to a number of 2x2x2 meter blocks (1 hex), determined by Potency as follows: 
\begin{quote}

These can be assembled as desired within range, including separate from each other. Any obstacle formed by the spell has 3 DT. The barrier disappears from the area after Potency/2 number of turns.

This spell allows quick access to character's inventory, the spirit of machines spring cleaning the target's inventory into a neat, categorized and quick to use space. For those with ill intent, it actively hinders the process of pilfering items. 

For the duration of the day, any items taken from inventory by the spell's target will have a lowered AP cost, as determined by caster's Potency. In addition, items in the target's inventory become slightly resistant to stealing, giving a character who attempts to steal from the target of this spell a -10 penalty on Sleight.

The AP cost of Ready Item from inventory is determined as follows:

By uttering a word of their choice, the shaman orders - or pleads - the spirit of machines to create a row of ethereal mines. This row can either start or pass through an area within 4 meters (2 hexes) from the caster, with one mine every 2 meters (1 hex).

The enemy may try to spot the mines before stepping through the area with a PER -2 roll.

Each mine has the stats of a frag grenade [3+(3)], with Tiny Splash radius.

If the space the spell is used in is too narrow to accommodate all the mines one could put down, the excess mines are discarded. For example, if a corridor is 6 meters (3 hexes) wide, and the caster can put down 5 mines, only 3 mines appear to cover the corridor from wall to wall.

The amount of mines created is determined by caster's Potency:

A wasteland critter comes to the caster's aid.

The caster has a bond with the surrounding wilds through the Spirit of Nature, able to call help from it by concentrating. However, the caster cannot directly determine what kind of critter will come to her aid.

Upon casting the spell, the GM allows one monster (animal, plant, or insect) from the Monster Manual or his own creation to join the caster's side, which then follows simple commands of the caster for the duration of the spell. If the creature is still present after the effect of the spell ends, it resumes its normal routines - it may walk off or turn hostile, for instance.  

If the caster has the \textit{Fluttershy's Apostle -perk}, the non-sentient creatures that appear with the use of this spell will not turn hostile unless injured. Likewise, non-sentients summoned with this spell do not adhere to the restrictions of the beforementioned perk.

\textbf{Note:} Robots, abominations, or sentient creatures do not heed the call of the caster.

The caster casts a green sigil on the ground, from which a ghostly green wind surrounds those within its reach. All who are trapped within the temporary wind-cocoon are poisoned by Spirit of Nature's gentle, but merciless hoof.

\newpage
The poison's strength and effect depends on the shaman's potency as follows:
\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	Tissue dmg; -1 HP per round, 1x40\% chance
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	Hallucinations; Minor Distraction, 1x60\% chance
		\item[20+ Potency] 		Deterioration; -2 to a SPECIAL of caster?s choosing, 2x60\% chance
	\end{description}	
\end{quote}

As the caster's Potency improves, they keep the previous tier's poison effect as a potential alternative. Upon casting, the caster chooses one effect to apply. However, the poison's chance is always the highest available to the caster.

Outside of combat, this spell can be used to poison inanimate objects such as food. The poison remains on the item for 24 hours, after which the effect disappears. Characters that use the item, or ingest the poison, have a chance of becoming poisoned as per the caster?s potency.

This spell cannot be used on weapons.

The caster creates multiple astral copies of himself. These copies occupy the same space the caster does, making hitting them harder for their enemies. The number of copies depends on the caster's Potency:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	2 copies
		\item[11-20 Potency] 4 copies
		\item[20+ Potency] 	    6 copies
	\end{description}	
\end{quote}

Enemies that target the caster have a 50 \% chance of hitting the right target, caster, instead of a copy after rolling their combat skill to see if they hit the target at all. If they fail, they hit one of the copies and destroy it instantly.

The caster sacrifices some of their own health to regenerate Strain to an ally, with a light, gentle incantation. The caster can sacrifice up to 5 HP to give their ally 2 Strain per 1 HP sacrificed. This damage ignores the caster's DT.

The caster determines a connection with persons, places, or items of their choosing, and when activating this spell, a ghostly trail will show caster the way to that person, place, or item and vice versa. The number of targets the spell can be connected to depends on the caster's Potency as follows:

%	\medskip
\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	3
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	6
		\item[20+ Potency]  	9
	\end{description}	
\end{quote}
%	\medskip

In order to forge a connection to the target, the caster must touch the target with her hooves while this spell is active. If the caster wants to add a new connection when their allowed amount is full, they have to discard an older connection. Once the connection has been set, there is no limit in range for the trail to be visible.

The ghostly trail is only visible to the caster and the connected person, and no one else. The ghostly light is not visible to unconscious or resting targets/caster and does not interfere with resting.

The spirit provides enhanced vision in the dark for the shaman, not unlike that of a night animal.

This spell allows caster to see as well during the night as they would during the day, for duration of Potency minutes, removing any penalties the caster would get from dim light, darkness and total darkness. 

If there is a sudden change in light to the brighter status, the user gains a Medium Distraction.

This spell bursts forth from the shaman's spirit as a brilliant rainbow of light, smashing onto their target in a great arc and damaging besides the target in the middle, also any enemies near the target. The spell deals both HP damage and Strain damage.

The spell deals 2+(3) damage, with the center taking full damage and any enemies surrounding them within the area take half of the damage inflicted. In addition, the center enemy will lose Strain according to the amount rolled with a die. What die is rolled to determine Strain loss depends on the caster's Potency.

The die used to roll for Strain damage, and the Area of Effect of the spell depend on potency, and are as follows:

The caster creates a sparkling cloud in a Small Splash Template, within the range of Potency*4 meters. Creatures, both friend and foe, that are inside this cloud must roll an Opposed PER roll against the caster. Those that fail their roll are Blinded for the duration of this spell. Creatures that come into contact with this spell after its summoning must roll a -1 PER to resist the effect. After the spell ends, the cloud disappears and the Blinded- status effect ends.

%The caster conjures ominous blood weapons out of the corpses of the fallen or herself.

%This spell requires either a fresh corpse (dead for less than 2 hours) or health (HP) to function. Only corpses of creatures that depend on blood can be used. Upon casting this spell, the sham must decide what kind of weapons she conjures (knife, fire axe, etc.). Only melee, unarmed or thrown weapons can be conjured.

%Spell conjures a number of determined weapons up to a maximum of 4. One corpse of a size 0 pony can produce up to 2 weapons, and in order to conjure more than that, more corpses are required. If no suitable corpses lay around, the caster may use her own life force to conjure weapons. For each weapon she conjures this way she loses 1 HP. The caster cannot kill herself upon casting this spell as once the caster's HP drops to a Pain Threshold, no weapons can be conjured.

%Conjured weapons float in the air near the caster by default. The caster must command them to attack or move away from her. Commanding these weapons is equal to the AP cost of the weapon in question, and Thaumaturgy roll is required to hit with the weapons. If not commanded, the weapon floats idly and does nothing. The weapons deal damage equal to their normal counterparts, but are destroyed if they are dropped by the caster after a Called Shot against said weapons.

Devours all light from the area, turning the place into darkness.

Upon casting Devouring Darkness, all light sources within the spell's radius are quenched. Any natural light disappears and the area becomes pitch black. To the outside the area looks very dark, like a strong shadow, and figures and other features are still visible, meaning that characters outside of the area of effect are not affected by the visibility penalty. To those inside the area the place becomes totally dark and they can barely see anything, resulting in the Visibility -40 penalty to hitting any targets, including adjacent ones.

In addition, upon casting the spell all creatures inside its Area of Effect lose 1 HP. DT, neither from armor or natural doesn't protect from this HP loss.

This spell has 30\% chance to inflict 1 Insanity on the caster.

The caster channels their spirit's power to damage them in exchange for higher damage on the target, transferring the caster's wounds twice-over. The caster sacrifices their HP to deal twice as much damage to their target's HP.

\medskip

The caster charms an area around themselves that makes enemies in the area fearful of her and averse to attacking the caster in favor of other targets. Allies are protected from the effect of this spell.

This unique status effect causes the targets in range to have to roll END to get over the effect and attack the caster instead of being forced to move to the closest possible target available. 

The targets in range also cannot use Withdraw-action to move away from the caster; this allows the caster to use an Attack of Opportunity on the moving target if the requirements for AoO are otherwise met.

Take the life force of another for yourself.

The spirit aura of the caster envelopes the target briefly, leeching the life force from the latter to the former.

The caster deals damage to the target equal to 1 + (2) and regains HP equal to HP loss inflicted. Target's DT applies, and excess HP healed is not stored. Potency determines additional damage dealt, as follows:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	+0 Die
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	+1 Dice
		\item[20+ Potency] 		+1 Base, +1 Dice

Caster becomes a cloud of dark fog, allowing her to move more freely and be immune to mundane attacks. 	

Spell transforms the caster into a dark cloud of smoke. While the spell is active, she is able to slip through small cracks and crevasses with ease, or enlarge herself to fill the entire room to intimidate creatures. The spell costs 5 AP and 3 Strain, and can be canceled at will.

While in Shadow Form, the caster moves double her normal speed. She is immune to physical damage, but MEWs, spells and other magical damage deal damage normally. She herself is unable to use any items while in this form, but may cast spells. If intimidating or frightening a foe while in this form, she adds her Potency to the roll as a bonus.

The caster can inhabit the same space as another character, and any character in the same space as Caster will start to suffocate, losing 2 HP each turn. If the character goes to 0 HP due to this HP loss, they will go unconscious from lack of air.

If the caster enlarges themselves during combat, the maximum they can enlarge themselves to is Large Splash Template. In this size, they will not cause targets to suffocate, due to their form not being condensed enough. Likewise, enemies gain a +10 to hit them.

Taking the form is physically and mentally taxing on the caster, which some would equal to milder forms of torture. Upon casting and every minute thereafter, the caster has a 50\% chance to gain 1 Insanity.

A sharp ice pillar bursts from the ground, dealing 2+(2) amount of damage to an enemy standing over it. The force of the erecting pillar sends the enemy flying afterwards, moving them 4 meters (2 Hexes) into a random direction.

Potency provides additional damage to the initial attack:
\begin{quote}

		\item[10-19 Potency] 	+2 DMG
		\item[20+ Potency]  	+4 DMG

After appearing, the pillar occupies the area it spawned on and can be used for Partial Cover and has 1 DT. It remains on the area for the rest of the spell's duration. In a hot environment, duration will shorten to 1 turn.

The target's frail mind is brought back together, their stream of consciousness guided by the spirit.

Upon casting the spell, the target may recover from Insanity she has suffered. The caster has to succeed in a Hard Medicine check to remove Insanity from the target, and gains a bonus equal to her Potency to the roll. The amount of Insanity the caster can remove depends on their Potency:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	1 Insanity
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	2 Insanity

The spirit soars through the air onto the spot the shaman designates, hitting the target and turning the area around them into an icy Difficult Terrain. Anyone that moves in this terrain needs to avoid slipping and falling prone in addition to taking more time to cross the icy surface.

This spell deals 2+(4) damage to the target, and they must succeed in END roll or suffer Freezing Status effect. Besides damage, a Small Splash area around the target turns into Difficult terrain. When moving through or in the area, characters have to make an AGI-roll or fall prone on the terrain.

Allows the target to interact with intangible substances, such as clouds and water, as if they were solid.

The spirit of Streams' power allows the target of the spell not only to walk on clouds and other non-tangible surfaces such as water and smoke, but to touch and interact with them as well. It lets the target use cloud technology, even if she's not a pegasus or a griffin. However, the target doesn't get wings, so they are unable to fend for themselves if they drop from a high altitude.

The caster's Potency determines how long the spell's duration is:

\begin{quote}

The sensible caster uses the Spirit of Trust's magic fueled into their voice to help a single ally to calm down from a Panic-Pain Threshold during combat situations. The character doesn't suffer from a Pain Threshold until they take further damage.

Outside of combat, this spell can be used to lower one's Insanity by 1 point, to a minimum of 0. If the target has acquired half or more of their maximum Insanity points, the caster suffers a -10 to their Thaumaturgy roll.

When used to overcome Insanity, this spell cannot be used again in 24 hours to lower Insanity, but can be used to calm down a target from Panic. A critically successful Thaumaturgy-roll causes the Insanity to lower by 2.

If the Insanity-lowering effect is used on an opponent, a CHA Opposed roll is required. If successful, the opponent temporarily becomes more lucid, but not necessarily docile.

\begin{verse}
	\textbf{Example:} Kenobi attempts to use Comforting Words to lower Maabara's Insanity, after she suffered a devastating blow to her psyche courtesy of in-game events. Maabara's maximum insanity is 6, and she currently has 4 points. Because Maabara has more than half of her maximum Insanity points, Kenobi's Thaumaturgy suffers a penalty of -10 to successfully perform this spell.

Conjure a swarm of magical knives that are thrown against the target.

The caster summons a swarm of magical blades out of thin air, directing them against a single opponent which she can see. Eldritch Knives ignore the \textit{Shield-spell} entirely.

The attack with the blades is considered a Burst attack. The hail of blades deals 2+(4) in damage, with Potency determining the amount of additional dice this attack gets:

Boosts the SPECIAL stats of the target.

The target of the spell has her physical or mental capabilities boosted for a period of time.

The caster chooses one SPECIAL stat to boost, excluding LCK. Said stat gains a bonus of 2 for Potency minutes. A target may benefit from only one SPECIAL bonus from Enhancement at a time.

Outside of combat, this spell can be used to heal SPECIAL damage, with caster's Potency determining the maximum amount of healed SPECIAL penalties. Permanently healing a target adds +3 to Strain cost. Multiple SPECIALs can be healed simultaneously, such as healing 1 point of STR damage, and 2 points of AGI damage. Critical success on the spell's Thaumaturgy roll allows 1 additional point of SPECIAL damage to be healed.

The shaman casts a spell on her ally, giving her inspiration through their shared bond and memories with one another. This manifests as a pleasant aura around the target, that slightly shimmers to the naked eye. 

The target gains a one-time use bonus of the following, with their choosing:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item +5 bonus on a Skill-roll
	\item +1 bonus on a SPECIAL-roll, including those to resist status effects
	\item +5 to Poison or Rad Resistance once.

Spirit forms a moldable shield of energy that protects against bullets and similar projectile attacks and Magic Energy Weapons. The shield is thin, transparent and matches the color of caster's eyes.

Shield can be wrapped around any target area within Potency*2 meters of the caster, covering maximum of 6 meters in its largest dimension. The caster chooses upon casting the spell whether the shield's position is fixed (doesn't move) or in relation to the caster (for example, always in front of the caster). Creatures and objects can go through Shield, but damaging projectiles interfere with it.


%\newpage
Shield has a DT determined by caster's Potency, and 5 HP tokens. The DT from Shield stacks with worn equipment, the exact amount determined by Potency as follows:
\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	1 DT
		\item[10-19 Potency]    2 DT
		\item[20+ Potency] 		3 DT
	\end{description}
\end{quote}

Attacks that deal more damage than the combined DT value damage the shield first. When the Shield's HP is reduced to 0, the spell ends, and the excess HP loss is dealt normally. The spell works both ways; attacks made from both sides of Shield are affected. Caster can manifest only one Shield at a time, but she can use other spells while Shield is active.

The spirit reveals the general attitude between two or more ponies through their empathic nature.

The spell manifests as thin lines between the targets, each color coded to show the social relationship between them. Among the most usual are hatred, envy, neutrality, friendship and love. Only the caster can see the formed lines, though \textit{Detection-spell} will make people aware that a spell is being used on the targets.

However, to gain this information between two targets they have to stand within the range of the spell from each other. On top of that, the caster must be able to see the line in question to decipher the connection.

\medskip

The spirit hides inside the shaman, enchanting their voice into a loud, booming, and vicious cry. All who are within a Small Splash area can feel the wail pierce their eardrums.

The spell's area of effect is centered on the caster, and the caster themselves is immune to the spell's effects. The spell causes damage according to the shaman's Potency as follows:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	1+(3)
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	2+(3)
		\item[20+ Potency] 	3+(4)
	\end{description}
\end{quote}

The damage ignores any DT on the afflicted targets. In addition, those taking damage have to roll an END check or gain Bleeding -status effect. If the shaman has the \textbf{Royal Canterlot Voice} -perk, the END check is made with a -1 penalty.

The shaman can use this attack multiple times during the duration of the spell, and only pays the Strain cost upon the spell's activation. Spell's normal AP cost applies to further uses.

	\end{tblr}

\medskip

Cause discord and friction between targets.

The spell changes each target's mood and attitude towards negative. Loving becomes indifferent, indifferent become quarrelsome, and quarrelsome become hostile.

Targets may make a CHA or INT roll with a penalty to resist the spell. If the spell is successful, the targets react to each other more negatively. Also, targets have 20\% chance to gain 1 Insanity if the spell is successful. The exact penalty is determined by the caster's Potency: 

\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	-10 penalty to roll
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	-20 penalty to roll
		\item[20+ Potency] 	-30 penalty to roll
	\end{description}
\end{quote}

This spell can be used to lower NPC Disposition by 1 per casting. It can also be made to influence targets' mood towards a particular individual more negative.

\textbf{Note:} Mindless creatures and robots are immune to the effects of this spell.

\medskip

The caster casts an Opposed roll of Thaumaturgy vs. INT against their target. If successful, the Spirit's force causes the target to gain Mind Control -status effect for Potency/3 turns. The spell's range is a Large Splash Template centered on the caster. 

When outside of battle, the mind-controlled character can be given simple orders. The target's speech turns monotone and robotic, and the character's allies can roll PER to notice something off with their friend.

The maximum number of targets affected depends on the caster's Potency as such:

%	\medskip
\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	1 target
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	2 targets

Makes the target invisible for a short duration.

The target of the spell is surrounded by a magical aura, rendering her completely invisible to others for a moment. If anyone tries to see or hit the target of Invisibility spell, they suffer PER penalty and Visibility penalty of 50, respectively. Locating the invisible entity is possible with other senses provided they create large enough sensory stimuli, such as knocking a can over or having a strong odor.

\medskip

The caster becomes phased between two dimensions - this and the spirit realm - making them intangible.

Upon casting Phase, the caster phases out of the current dimension with only a faint outline of them being left behind. They are able to step through solid objects for the duration of the spell, and they only take damage from magical attacks, such as Arcane Blast and MEWs.

This spell does not turn the caster invisible, but they become ethereal, which gives them a bonus of +10 on Sneak.

The spell's duration is determined by the caster's Potency as follows, and has different duration for inside and outside of combat.

The spirit circles around the immediate vicinity of the caster, granting a dark veil that hides the allies within range.

The caster provides an illusionary aura around herself, rippling and distorting their form for anyone else watching.

The spell grants the caster and up to 4 allies - within Small Splash template from her - a Sneak bonus equal to her Potency.

The shaman creates a frightening visage in front of a target, which will distract the target.  The visage is usually something unexpected and terrifying, relying on the caster's imagination while scrying just a little into the mind of their target to pull the spell off.

The shaman's Potency determines the spell's effectiveness in distracting their target as follows:
\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	Minor Dist.
		\item[10-19 Potency] 	Medium Dist.

Using this spell can lower Karma, if used for particularly evil acts.

\begin{verse}
	\textbf{Example:} Kenobi casts Venom on three enemies. His potency is 15, which means that he has available the following effects; Tissue damage and hallucinations. He chooses to try to inflict tissue damage (-1 HP per round) on his enemies. Due to his potency, he can cast it with 1x60\% chance even though the effect is of a lower potency tier.
