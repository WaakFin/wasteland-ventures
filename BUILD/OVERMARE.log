Dimensions can be in units of em, ex, in, pt, pc,
cm, mm, dd, cc, nd, nc, bp, or sp; but yours is a new one!
I'll assume that you meant to say pt, for printer's points.
To recover gracefully from this error, it's best to
delete the erroneous units; e.g., type `2' to delete
two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)

! Improper \prevdepth.
\tabu@verticalspacing ...tempdimc \the \prevdepth 
                                                  \@tempdima \dimexpr \ht \t...
l.1237 	\end{tabu}
                  
You can refer to \spacefactor only in horizontal mode;
you can refer to \prevdepth only in vertical mode; and
neither of these is meaningful inside \write. So
I'm forgetting what you said and using zero instead.

! You can't use `\dimexpr' in restricted horizontal mode.
\tabu@verticalspacing ...epth \@tempdima \dimexpr 
                                                  \ht \tabu@box +\abovetabul...

Sorry, but I'm not programmed to handle this case;
I'll just pretend that you didn't ask for it.
If you're in the wrong mode, you might be able to
return to the right one by typing `I}' or `I$' or `I\par'.

! You can't use `\hrule' here except with leaders.
\tabu@verticalspacing ...nalstrut \@gobble \hrule 
                                                  height\@tempdima depth\@te...
l.1237 	\end{tabu}
                  
To put a horizontal rule in an hbox or an alignment,
you should use \leaders or \hrulefill (see The TeXbook).

! Missing number, treated as zero.

A number should have been here; I inserted `0'.
(If you can't figure out why I needed to see a number,
look up `weird error' in the index to The TeXbook.)
