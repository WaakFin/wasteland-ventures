	The world of post-apocalypse Equestria is filled with a variety of creatures with most out to get your head. This book seeks to give examples of creatures that populate the many different places in the Wasteland, from the darkest ruins to open plains and beyond.
	
	These creatures, both sentient and not, serve as the many antagonists and obstacles to the players' characters, and to give them conflict to solve, either by speaking the forces opposing them down or by giving them a solid whacking. More often than not, it's the solid whacking.
	
	Though this book offers statistics to the monsters both mutated and not, they should be seen more as guidelines than hard facts, and can be tinkered with to suit the purpose of the story and the party level.

	\section*{Types of Mutants}
	%	\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Types of Mutants}
	Mutants have many different types, which can mean they resist or are outright immune to some of the game's concepts. This chapter also focuses on explaining what the common guidelines are for the various creatures that belong into a particular grouping.
	
	Creatures, both sentient and ``feral'' have an assortment of skills they generally utilize. Most are due to training and innate abilities and features. These are for quick access and reference. In a situation, where player characters use skills against unspecified values, such as Barter to strike a deal with an Equitron, creatures use either an untrained value of 15 or 20, or freely given values to create individuality to said creatures.
	
	\begin{verse}
		\emph{\textbf{Note:} Certain creatures, such as most insects and robots have additional body parts (antennae and combat inhibitors exclusively) that are considered limbs and which can be crippled. Hitting these parts will cause the creature to be unable to discern enemies and friends and attack the closest creature next to it.}
	\end{verse}
	
	\begin{description}		
		\item[Abomination:]  What commonly differentiates Abominations from other Mutants is often the lack of proper adaptation and evolution to the Wasteland. Resemblance of Abominations usually stands out like something forcibly changed them to their state, without any consideration whether change was beneficial. Abominations have, however, developed or gained many magical and necrotic abilities beyond most magicians. They can often also be traced back to species that was or is sentient.
		\item[Animal:] Animals are perhaps the most diverse creatures of the bunch, and unlike other creatures, do not have any special rules for them.
		\item[Insect:] Insects have their own caste from animals as they have chitinous exoskeleton and often a pair of antennae as well as three pair of legs. This means insects usually have more legs to cripple, functioning relatively well even if two of their legs are out, but their antennae are also a part for crippling effect; this effect causes the insect to gain Mind-Controlled and Enraged status effects.
		\item[Machine:] Machines are creations of science, hulking metallic creations varying from simply automated turrets to robots of very equine characteristics. Common to all robots is their fearlessness, making Intimidation pointless against them, inability to bleed like living creatures, and their inability to feel pain, keeping them functioning even with critical damage. Machines do bear weakness to EMP based weapons and can be shutdown.
		\item[Mutant:] Mutant means that the creature was mutated from some Pre-War era creature either by balefire or Taint. These are the most common creatures in the manual. Mutants have a higher tolerance to radiation but are often not immune to it.
		\item[Non-Mutant:] Non-Mutated creatures are the ones that due to immunity to radiation and taint have remained the same even after the apocalypse. Their most notable trait is that radiation has no effect on them at all, rendering weapons that deal radiation damage moot against them.
		\item[Plant:] Plants are diverse, with various species being born of Radiation or Taint mutations, to completely remaining unscathed by them surviving from the times before war. Common trait to plants is their complete inability to move or simply move remarkably slow. However, plants cannot be Crippled.
		\item[Sentient:] Best way to describe Sentient beings is their ability to communicate with the common language, and think rationally; assuming they wish to do so. Sentient beings are most commonly other equines and griffons, thus their abilities and resiliencies are quite equal, each having fairly low Radiation tolerance and nearly zero chance to survive contamination by Taint. However, their nature can vary from highly sophisticated societies that can be interacted with ease to purely savage tribal groups that will see outsiders little more than prey.

	\section*{Looting Mutants}
	%	\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Looting Mutants}
	In the \emph{Mutant Manual}, each creature has a small collection of items listed for the players to loot for themselves. Aside from two exceptions looting doesn't require a check to perform. These exceptions are doubling the amount of particular item the character can get, and items that have a chance of being on the lootable character.
	
	Doubling the number of lootable items is usually done by rolling either \textbf{Survival}, \textbf{Mechanics} or \textbf{Science}. Items of this type have the required skill listed next to them. 
	
	Some items require a successful LCK roll for the item to be in the enemy's inventory. Such items are books, magic notes and magazines, which can be carried around by sentient creatures.
	
	In case of there being a large amount of downed enemies, the looting can be collective of all the creatures, to reduce the time the party spends pulling off armors and prying weapons from dead hooves.
	
	Due to these lists not being exhaustive and mentioning every part of a creature down to their pinky toes, PCs sometimes want to get parts that are not listed on the list. It is suggested that the GM looks at the possible skill requirements of a similar part and proceeds accordingly. These parts may require a Survival, Mechanics or Science roll for successful removal.
	
	After a PC has managed to find what they can from the downed enemy, the enemy is considered empty, even if another PC decided to go through them in more detail later.

	\subsection*{Description:}	
	Alicorns are amongst the most feared creatures that the Equestrian Wasteland has to offer. Cunning, strong and possessing all of the other pony races' abilities, these artificial Taint-created alicorns have a hivemind they use to communicate and share experiences. This means that no trick works on them twice, making them especially lethal. 
	
	All alicorns are solely female, and are in search of a way to attempt converting male unicorns into male Alicorns, though before the Day of Sunshine and Rainbows, this goal has not been achieved.
	Alicorns are often solidary encounters all across the Wasteland, but sometimes they do group together when the Goddess commands it.
	The Goddess is the Alicorn all other alicorns heed to and communicate with telepathically.
	Alicorns are highly intelligent creatures, and as such they can be bargained with, but considering how lowly they often wield the common pony, such negotiations often require one's worth proven.
	
	It is not known to many what alicorns do on their spare time -or if they have the concept of it, even- and as such it is hard to determine how they group and live. Most often than not, one encounters an Alicorn on the prowl for unicorns to convert into artificial alicorns via the use of Taint.
	
	Alicorns possess heightened, special versions of certain unicorn spells that depend on the alicorn's coat color. With blue Alicorns, this is the Invisibility-spell, green alicorns have a more powerful variant of the Shield-spell, and the purple alicorns have superb Teleport-spell.

		\textbf{Irradiated Firestorm (1/min, 8 AP):} The balefire phoenix engulfs themselves in green flames and swoops down to their enemy, dousing a Small Splash Template in flames. This attack deals 2+(3) fire damage and if any damage goes through, inflicts a burning-status effect. In addition to this, it gives 1 Rad 3x40\% to all who come in contact with the flames.
		
		\textbf{Sunburst (6 AP):} The balefire phoenix releases a shining flash of light targets all within Large Burst area, causing Medium Distraction to all who fail a PER check.
		
		\textbf{Firebreath (4 AP):} Balefire Phoenix can breathe fire from their beaks, at the range of one adjacent tile in front of them. This attack deals 1+(3) fire damage, and inflicts Burning-status effect if any damage goes through the target's DT.
		
		\textbf{Biological Immortality:} Balefire Phoenix occasionally renew themselves by bursting into flame and raising from the ashes. However, unlike with regular phoenixes, the Balefire Phoenix's ashes are radioactive, giving 1 Rad with 2x50\% to any who are adjacent to a pile of it. Disintegration from MEW's does not kill a Balefire Phoenix, but instead starts the renewal process. Balefire phoenix is however still vulnerable to diseases and predators like any other animal.
		
		\textbf{Rad Resistant:} Balefire Phoenix are immune to the harmful effects of magical radiation. Highly irradiated areas heal them equal to each token of rads gained. In addition to this, if they have Major Rad poisoning or more, their Firebreath reaches up to two hexes in front of them and deals 2+(3) Fire damage instead.
		
		\textbf{Flying:} Balefire Phoenix have working wings, thus they are capable of flight. Phoenix's flight speedis 1 AP for 6 meter (3 Hexes).
		
		\textbf{Fire Immunity:} Balefire Phoenix is immune to Fire Damage, as it's body is partially made from flames.
		
		\textbf{Poison Resistant:} Balefire Phoenix have mediocre Poison Resistance of 25, mostly due to their magically enhanced but frail bodies.

	Balefire phoenix is a phoenix bird mutated by -as the name would imply- the necromantic Balefire that destroyed the world. Now sporting a bright green and gold plumage, this lithe bird soars through the skies like a radioactive beacon.
	
	Most balefire phoenix have not altered their way of living from their unmutated brethren; the female lays 2-4 eggs, which are raised by both the male and female. In this regard, balefire phoenix resemble most birds that mate for life. They tend to host their nest up high, either on trees or on the many derelict buildings. Due to mating for life, most balefire phoenix are seen in pairs, though on occasion one can find a lonesome one.
	
	Most balefire phoenix eat small vermin such as unmutated rats, though they have been seen to carry off even a molerat pup on an occasion, showing that they do not turn up their beaks at bigger food sources.
	
	Generally, balefire phoenix are not aggressive on sight, but if they have a nest of eggs or chicks, they will fend them ferociously. There have been some records of balefire phoenix being tameable, but this is a feat all of its own; balefire phoenix do not friend equines willy-nilly, and gaining one's trust is a merit of its own.
	
	Due to their nature as a phoenix, the bird is largely immortal in a sense. Though they can succumb to heavy injuries and toxins, they are technically unaffected by time. When a balefire phoenix nears the end of its cycle, it begins to shed its wonderful plumage and finally it bursts into flames to be born anew, with its body back to a youthful adult. Reaching this phase can take several decades.

	Bloodwings are bats mutated by Balefire Radiation, and as such they share many elements with the non-mutated bats that used to grace the Equestrian nights. It is currently unknown if the Bloodwing evolved from the Fruit bat or the Vampire Fruit Bat, it is certain that this species is favoring blood as their main source of nutrients. 
	
	The bloodwing's saliva has magical component to it that keeps a wound it has made unable to close normally, making this creature lethal even if one were able to get away from it after being bitten. 
	In addition, the bloodwings do not, as inaccurately depicted in many a Wastelander's tall tale, suck blood, but rather lick the flowing nectar of life from the still-alive victim. And the wound is rarely a dainty little bite mark on the victim's body, but an ragged, ripped gnash.
	
	\bigskip
	Bloodwings live in large colonies, inhabiting any sufficiently dark and moderately undisturbed place that they can get to. Much like other bat species, the bloodwings sleep upside down. Bloodwings often travel in smaller groups of 4-6 individuals, but sometimes an entire colony can be on the move at the same time, likely due to looking for a new nest. 
	Said nest usually consists female groups and their offspring, with a few adult males inhabiting the nest. Sometimes adult male bloodwings will forcibly remove a male offspring from the colony, which then results in the lone bloodwing joining a new colony. 
	
	Bloodwings cannot survive long without a meal, and due to this and their social structure, bloodwings can and often do share meals, by full-bellied bats regurgitating blood for the starving individuals. It is not known if the bloodwings are more likely to do this to their family members, or all members of the colony equally.
	
	Bloodwings are largely blind, and locate prey with their echolocation instead, often swooping down and pinning down their prey for easier feeding. Bloodwings also hunt during night-hours, so the likelihood of running into one during the day is slim at best. It is still best advised to try not to remain in old ruins during the night, due to bloodwings being active.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Bloatsprites are one of the most common mutated insects, perhaps only bested by the radroach in their adaptability, found inhabiting a myriad of habitats. Mutated from the once relatively common pest parasprite, this round insect darts around the air with erratic patterns. The bloatsprite has essentially replaced parasprites of the War-time Equestria, with the non-mutated parasprite become nearly extinct due to magical radiation. 
	
	While parasprites could be described as cute, bloatsprites are the very opposite; the balefire radiation has made their body bloated -hence the name- with gaseous build-up, like a toxic balloon. The presumably painful transformation has also altered their aggression, as they are far more aggressive towards other creatures than parasprites.
	
	Bloatsprites shoot the venomous spikes from their body at their targets with surprisingly decent accuracy, though they lack in range. Much like the non-mutated parasprite, bloatflies eat anything they can get to in seconds, and have ferocious appetite toppled with their extreme omnivore tendencies. The list of things not part of bloatsprite's dietary habits is quite short indeed, and equine flesh is not included in that list.
	
	\bigskip
	Bloatsprites mate asexually, a trait they're retained from their non-mutated brethren. Once a bloatsprite has consumed enough nutrients, it regurgitates a duplicate of themselves, though color variations may occur. It is currently unknown and untested how much nutrients are required for duplication, but certain scientist did record a bloatsprite devouring a two-seat skywagon and several street signs before regurgitating a replica.
	
	Both regular bloatsprites and the Fillydelphia bloatsprite make nests preferably in tight, confined spaces such as abandoned Stables and houses, and their territories can be quite large, several kilometers in length, centered on the nest. In addition to this, some members of the bloatsprite colony break off and wander the Wastes in search of a nest of their own, causing the species to be very mobile and thus often encountered threat.
	
	\bigskip
	Two other variants of the bloatfly exist; \textbf{Fillydelphia bloatsprite} and \textbf{Necrosprite}, with the former mutated from the intense balefire radiation into a more lethal variant, and the latter essentially dying and coming back as a twisted remnant of a parasprite, mutated by the Pink Cloud -megaspell. Of the three, necrosprites are the most deadly, as they are practically unkillable, though they can be dispersed with enough force.
	
	\bigskip
	Necrosprites, due to the necromantic magical energy are essentially deceased, and their ghost-like appearance reflects this. Due to this ethereal trait, necrosprites care little about conventional bullets fired at them. Magic is the key element to dispersing the necrosprites, though they cannot be ultimately killed.
	Due to this same necromantic energy, necrosprites do not breed, nor do they truly feed. However, they have been shown to attack passersby with little to no provocation.
	
	Necrosprites' bodies inherent magic siphons away at the targets' mental capabilities if they manage to swarm a person, which can be devastating on longer exposure. This makes them rather dangerous creatures, even if their territories are usually mere few kilometers wide and which they rarely expand.

	Brahmin are what remains of the many sentient cows that inhabited the war-time Equestria, now mutated into two-headed beings that, much like ghouls, have both sentient and ``feral'' members in their species. 
	
	Though unlike feral ghouls who attack anything they perceive as a threat, the feral brahmin are quite calm and docile, often running away from attacking creatures rather than confronting them.
	This calm behavior, as well as brahmins' strong backs have made them ideal for pulling wagons and carrying heavy items such as merchandise or goods. Thus merchants are often seen with a brahmin or two, sentient or no. 
	
	If the brahmin in question is sentient, only one of the heads will be capable of thought and reasoning, while the other head is that of a regular animal. The two heads act separately, hence why there is no shared intelligence between the heads. 
	
	\bigskip
	It is theorized that the mutation that took root, the two-headed trait, might have developed as a defense mechanism to give the brahmin more time to get away from predators. This is why brahmin rarely suffer much from one crippled head. If forced to, brahmin will fend for themselves by ramming and trampling their opponents with their large, hefty body.
	Brahmin are largely hairless, aside from some tufts of fur that still clings to their body. They have a somewhat thicker skin than fur-coated ponies, perhaps so they can endure the elements better.
	
	Brahmin are capable of equipping armor and often are dressed in heavy armor for added protection in caravans. Sentient brahmin can also use guns to fend for themselves, though they use a modified firing bit, due to the size of their mouth and teeth breaking guns' bits fashioned for Earth Ponies.
	
	\bigskip
	Brahmin, much like cows that preceded them, are strict herbivores and unlike ponies who can wrangle nutrients from meat, brahmin cannot. Much like cows, brahmin produce milk, though it is slightly radioactive due to the brahmin's mutations.
	
	Perhaps due to the possibility of sentience, some pony communities that consume meat do not use brahmin as cattle. Of course, there are communities that don't give a molerat's behind for such feeble things such as ``morality of possibly kinda-sorta cannibalism'', as described by a interviewed wastelander from a village in east Equestria.

	This large insectoid creature is a blend of bears and bees, creating what is probably the worst kind of mixture in the history of hybrids. Intelligent and armed with loads of brute force, the Bugbear is not your typical house-fly; you're going to need a bigger fly-swatter.
	
	The Bugbear, despite having no skill in using weapons or armor, is intelligent enough to understand pony and zebra speech, though it is incapable of replicating it. This can make it a formidable foe, as it can understand tactics of its opponents and plan ahead. This intelligence and force combined with its nasty temper and penchant for wanton destruction makes it the tyrant of the skies, as it is quite keen on growing its territories, sentient beings be damned. Somewhat more common in Enclave societies, this insectoid creature has wrecked many pegasus villages and settlements.
	
	\bigskip
	In the past, this malicious behavior has landed this creature and its kin straight to Tartarus, deemed too malicious to be kept close to society and they kept company to many evil creatures.
	
	Unlike other bear-like creatures such as Yao Guai or Star-Spawn, Bugbears do not hibernate, though they're fairly rare sight in winter months nonetheless. Out of all of them, Bugbears have the shortest life-span of just 10 years.

	Changelings are an insectoid species that live in hives much like ants or termites. They are pony-sized, and do not eat meat or plants. Instead, they sustain themselves by feeding on other creatures' love, which they drain like vampires.
	
	Changelings live in hives ruled by a queen, below whom is a caste system of warriors and workers. Most of these hives are small due to a not-surprising shortage of love in the wasteland. Thus, many of these hives resort to banditry to survive, luring unwary travellers away from safety by posing as friends, relatives or other ponies in need of help. In fact, it is this ability to take on different shapes and forms that is the changelings' greatest asset, allowing them to infiltrate places and fool ponies. Some of them might even live among ponies for years, posing as a just another resident of a settlement.
	
	Due to their isolation from each other, each hive has its own culture and customs. Some prey on caravans much like raiders, and others focus on infiltration tactics. Thus changelings themselves could potentially be anywhere.
	
	\bigskip
	Changeling Queens never steer far from the hive, as they oversee its day-to-day operations and command. It is only rarely that they travel far - often the reason for such travel is to relocate the hive to a much more safer spot. And even when relocating the Queen won't show her true self, having the same transformative powers as the warriors and workers. In tight spots - or expert infiltration - the Changeling Queen may use their special hypnotizing magic to gain temporary allies, to disable defenses and to better infiltrate.

		\textbf{Bite (3 AP):} A powerful jaw accompanied by large twin fangs, that can easily pierce flesh. This attack deals 1+(2) damage and ignores 1 DT. In addition, it has a 1x40\% chance of poisoning their target. The target removes 1 HP per turn, until healed with an Antivenom, spells or if the target dies. This HP loss is applied on the target's turn. Multiple bites do not enhance the poison once it has entered the target.

	Chimera, a creature not in any way related to the mythical and likely extinct Chimera of the Fire Swamp, is the only creature not mutated by Taint or balefire, being instead the result of a magical accident.
	
	Chimera are a mix of snakes, cats and some type of venomous insect. The insect part is often noticed only after the creature has attacked, as its venomous bite injects eggs into the target as well. If not treated quickly, the Chimera young will burst out of the host after 24 hours, if the poison doesn't manage to deal them in quicker. 
	
	Thankfully antivenom, if delivered quickly, is often enough to dispel both the poison and the now-dead eggs as the neutralized poison has allowed for the host body's immune system to attack the eggs as a foreign object. The eggs, little bigger than a button, drop out of the wound as if pushed out.
	
	\bigskip
	Chimera, due to their small size and relatively weak body prefer not to stick to a battle, instead opting for hit-and-run tactics; rush at target, bite them to insert eggs, retreat for a place to hide in. They often stalk their targets, preferring to hit solitary members than a big group.
	Chimera can be noticed with some ease even in darkness, as their large cat-eyes reflect light. 
	
	Chimera are not good swimmers and have an aversion to water. Due to this, they are also extremely rare, as the Stable 24 they origin from is surrounded by a river, meaning they have not gotten the chance to expand.

		\textbf{Petrifying Gaze (7 AP):} Cockatrice's eyes unleash a magical spell-like reaction on anything it makes eye-contact with, slowly turning the target to stone. Target may try to resist locking eyes with the beast with a PER-2 roll, and a failed roll results in eye-contact. The target is fully petrified in 3 turns. Characters with sunglasses get no penalty on their PER roll.
		
		Cockatrice can revert the process at will, but shattered petrified creatures remain stone. Killing the cockatrice will result in its victims remaining as statues forever. 
		
		\textbf{Coward:} Cockatrice is not an especially strong fighter, and tends to try hit-and-run tactics with its Stare-ability. Cockatrice have a -2 on INT to resist intimidation tactics. When it reaches Pain Thresholds, there is a chance it will flee as if intimidated.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Cockatrice are serpents with leathery, dragon-like wings and the head of a rooster. They are solitary mythological creatures, and have somewhat mean, bully-like behavior; they prefer to attack creatures that they consider to be easy targets. 
	
	Largely cowards by nature, they tend to try to surprise their target with their stone turning gaze and run away, leaving the victim behind. Due to the abovementioned cowardice, they are easy to intimidate, should one get a hold of them. The cockatrice can undo their petrifying spell at will, but any petrified creature that was shattered will remain a statue. Killing the cockatrice also renders the statue to remain stone forever.
	
	\bigskip
	As far as can be deciphered, it seems that the cockatrice doesn't actually hunt ponies and other big, sentient creatures for food, but rather to decorate their territory for mating season; the bigger their statue collection, the more fearless and mighty they seem, all in purpose of attracting a female cockatrice to mate with.
	
	Cockatrice prefer areas with plenty of hiding places, such as thick forests or urban ruins and generally avoid any open plains-like area if they can.

		\textbf{Firebreath (10 AP):} The notorious trait of dragons, is their ability to breath fire of immense temperatures. The firebreath can take two forms: 
		
		First form is a line of fast scorching flames, with a range of 10 meters (5 hexes). This deals 5+(6) damage, with a 2x20 \% chance of causing Burning.
		
		The second form is a fiery sphere that sets an area of Large Splash template ablaze. This area burns for 3 turns, dealing 3+(2) damage per turn, with a chance of causing Burning.
		
		\textbf{Bite (7 AP):} A mighty jaw with rows of razor sharp fangs. Deals 6+(3) damage, and ignores 4 DT. Dragons have Reach of 6 meters (3 hexes).
		
		\textbf{Flying:} Dragons have working wings, thus they are capable of flight. Dragons' flight speed is 1 AP for 6 meters (3 Hexes).

	\subsection*{Description:}
	The mighty dragon is a sight to behold, with their strong, durable frame and thick scales that cover them from head to toe. Along with their magical dragonfire and capability to withstand intense heat, to the point that lava and firestorms are little more than a bath and a shower for them.
	
	Dragons are some of the more fearsome foes one can find, but they are sentient creatures, and as such, can be willing to negotiate. Especially if their favorite food, gemstones, are involved. However, should negotiations go awry, battle is imminent as a slighted dragon is an angry one. Then, out comes the firebreath and metal-shredding claws.
	
	Most dragons value competition and strength of individual, leaving many pony-customs of friendship and cutesy things in the dust, though this behavior is more pronounced in the young dragons. Older dragons tend to turn vain, but less aggressively macho.
	
	Dragons' size is somewhat affected by their hoards and greed needed to gather such a large collection of priceless items, gold and gems; though they do grow more naturally as well. The bigger the hoard, the larger the dragon.
	
	\bigskip
	A Dragon Lord is the ruler of the dragon, usually decided by a competition, though it may vary what kind the competition actually is. This competition is usually designed by the previous Dragon Lord, who will relinquish the symbol of their might, a Bloodstone Scepter, to the winner of the competition.
	
	Dragons are a rare sight in the Equestrian Wasteland, as they usually reside in Dragon lands, described as a barren, flat and stony plain with very little animal or plantlife.

		\textbf{Enclave Weaponry:} Any forces of the Enclave that come to contact with the Wasteland make a point to wear the intimidating Enclave Power Armor. This is also to shield them from the lingering radiation. In battle, Enclave soldiers use Cloud weapons nearly exclusively, as they're an Enclave design. Enclave Power Armor has 6 DT.
		
		\textbf{Purity:} Enclave is made up of pegasi exclusively, and consider other races -and groundborn pegasi- as beneath them. Enclave soldiers get a (+1) to damage when targeting other sentient races.
		
		\textbf{Organized:} The Enclave have hierarchy of leadership. They strike as units and groups of various sizes, usually under at least one commander. Eliminating such commander often leaves rest of the team at disarray and demoralized.
		
		\textbf{Poison Resistant: }Due to their sheltered life up in the clouds, a lot of the harmful toxins never reached the pegasi of the Enclave. Due to this, their Poison resistance is 5, though they can equip armor to make up for this handicap.
		
		\textbf{Rad Intolerant:} The cloudcover has kept much of the Wasteland's harms out of the pegasi lifestyle, and as such, they never grew a tolerance to the lingering radiation that other races were exposed to constantly. The Enclave's Rad Resistance is 0. Many try to shield themselves with appropriate apparel.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	The Grand Pegasus Enclave, often referred to as Enclave for short, is a militant, technologically advanced yet somewhat secretive faction of Pegasus ponies that serves as the governing body above the clouds. They claim to be the continuation of pre-War Equestrian society, proving their point with extreme measures if need be. As such, they are extremely isolationist in nature and won't take in new members from below the cloud cover, styling anyone born below the clouds as ``a mutant'', even other pegasi. 
	
	The Enclave society is strictly regulated, following the old traditions of Pegasi culture - even from prior Equestria's time as a united nation. While highly militaristic in nature, all important decisions go through a legislative council for approval - even military campaigns.
	
	\bigskip
	The Enclave utilizes cloud weaponry in all its forms - from pistols and rifles to various cloudships. The exact nature of the scale of their weaponry is unknown, as their excursions to the Wasteland are in small numbers. 
	
	When the Enclave sends teams to the Wastes, they're well-equipped and have clear instructions on their mission - and are always accompanied by a team leader, their rank dependent on the size of the team. Their excursion to the Wasteland is for the completion of the mission only, and they won't let anyone stand in their way to its eventual success.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Equitrons are four-legged mechanical beings that resemble their creators loosely. Slow and cumbersome, these robotic ponies may have easily been surpassed later down the line with an improved model if it were not for the Great War. However, they're reliable and programmed to specific tasks, thus making them ideal in many scenarios, both pre- and post-War.
	
	Equitrons are noted to be the first moving robots, and are very sturdy as a result. Their original development cause by Robronco has been forgotten, but a myriad of models exist based on the same base model - be it construction, peacekeeping, or monorail ticket inspector role. They're very strictly programmed - thus working against the robot's instructions may incur its wrath and pacifying protocols. An expert mechanic may tweak the robot's parameters to more of their liking, and a skilled hacker may reprogram the robot from a linked terminal.
	
	\bigskip
	Given the myriad of roles it was assigned for, one can easily find Equitrons almost anywhere where there has been ponies, most often within urban centers. Due to their programming, they hardly wander off of their designated areas. And when they do, they're certainly glitchy in coding and hostile in attitude.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Dogs, the canine friends of ponies, did weather the destructive end of the world like their masters. Most that survived and were left without their owners quickly learned the harsh truth of the wasteland, turning them to their feral, untamed ways. 
	
	Feral dogs can be seen roaming almost anywhere in the wastes. No spot is too strange for them, and with a large pack they can claim any ruin as their home. They do have a tendency to steer clear from heavily robotically guarded buildings, for they cannot down the mechanical beasts with ease.
	
	\bigskip
	Feral dogs can appear alone, but most often one can find them in groups of 2-4, depending on location. They tend to rush to a target, aiming for the throat to take the target down as quickly as possible. However, unless they manage to catch one unawares, they're relatively easy to fend off.
	
	These dogs can, and often have been tamed, but it has sometimes taken a few generations' worth of feral dogs to bring back the companion many ponies know and love. These dogs are often bred and sold as companions to all. Some raise them to be attack and guard dogs, while others prefer a calmer companion for their daily tasks. 
	
	\bigskip
	Feral Mongrels behave much in the same way, with the only exception to the feral dog being their irradiated, pale and hairless skin and slightly more intelligent behavior. Feral dogs and Feral mongrels rarely mix, preferring to have their own, separate packs.

\subsubsection*{Additional Combat Details:}
\begin{verse}
	\textbf{Irradiated Hoof (5 AP):} Canterlot Ghoul's hoof-strike deals 3+(5) damage, and gives 2 Rad Tokens at 2x50\% chance.
	
	\textbf{Pink Cloud Broadcaster (1/min, 5 AP, 3 Strain):} Some Canterlot Ghouls have Pip-Bucks that, similarly to themselves, have become warped with the necromantic magic of Pink Cloud. Once per minute (10 rounds), the Canterlot Ghoul can disperse a necromantic sound that deals 1+(4) damage directly to those in range. The attack's range is \textit{Small Splash area}, centered on the caster.
	
	\textbf{Pink Breath (10 AP):} The necromantic magic surging and upholding the ghoul's body is evident in their pink-hued breath that they can release, carried by the necromantic magic towards their target. This attack deals 1+(2) damage, and may inflict a host of status-effects and poison. These status effects are: Bleeding, Blinded and Dazed. Each effect is resisted separately. In addition, the breath can poison their target with an effect that stops their Strain-recovery from functioning with 1x 50\% chance. \textbf{This attack ignores DT.}
	
	\textbf{Rad Healing (1/min, 8 AP):} The ghoul may choose to discard 2-5 Rad Tokens, and replenish an equal amount of HP tokens and/or Crippled Conditions, if any are present.
	
	\textbf{Self-Restoration:} Canterlot Ghouls regain HP each turn. Canterlot Ghouls heal 2 HP per turn. Their head is their weak point, and cutting it off will render them temporarily inactive, only for them to resurrect with Canterlot?s necromantic magic in 24 hours. If they?re vaporized/turned into goo by energy weapons/magic, their resurrection stops functioning.
	
	\textbf{Quick Runner:} Canterlot Ghouls are fast, and due to this they get a +2 to their Initiative rolls.
	
	\textbf{Painless:} Having been mutated not by radiation but by Pink Cloud, the Canterlot Ghoul feels so little pain that they do not suffer from Pain Thresholds.
	
	\textbf{Instinct:} Canterlot Ghouls are able to use their innate magic, though in limited ways. For instance, Unicorns have General school spells available to them, while griffins and pegasi can take to the air and fly towards their targets. Earth Pony and Zebra ghouls have +(1) to their damage. 
	
	\textbf{Poison Immunity:} Due to their unique circumstances, Canterlot Ghouls are immune to Poison effects.

	While turning into a ghoul provides one with the benefits of longevity, sometimes the age will catch up on the ghouls. Or some other trauma made them lose their minds, turning them to the feral state. While still capable of basic instincts, the feral ghouls differ from their non-feral cousins in that they no longer think rationally, being closer to animals with their sentience.
	
	Feral ghouls gather together in small packs, preferring dark and cool environments to call their little base - like basements or underground passageways. They do not, however, fear light as some may think, perfectly capable of wandering the wasteland. Occasionally they gather in  irradiated areas, as they note the restorative effects of the fallout - as with normal ghouls, not only feral ghouls do not suffer negative effects from radiation, they are practically healed by it. 
	
	\bigskip
	Feral ghouls do not create complex plans of attack - they tend to swarm any intruder they spot, usually alerting their pack with a scream for additional power before charging. They do, however, retain some memories of their old life, and usually use the skills and tactics they have learned in occasion - often helping the feral pack as a whole.
	
	Glowing ones are special ghouls, having become conduits of radiation themselves. They emit this radiation around them, and occasionally shed it in large bursts around them - effectively healing their ghoul friends.
	
	\bigskip
	Canterlot Ghouls are a very special variant of a feral ghoul; instead of having been mutated through regular magical radiation, they've instead been warped much further by the Pink Cloud -megaspell that decimated the city they're named after. 
	
	They do not tend to stray far from Canterlot Mountain, most commonly found in the forgotten ruins themselves, or the surrounding decimated villages at the base of the mountain. They're known to be nigh-unkillable, resisting damage by resurrecting from many normally fatal blows. However, dismemberment, especially by divorcing their heads from their bodies, and getting reduced to ash or goo will be effective against them. 
	
	Slightly more intelligent than their fellow ferals, Canterlot ghouls tend to ambush their prey. Also as a signal to their slightly better intelligence is the fact that they're able to discern sane ghouls from ferals, and often attack sane ghouls the same as they would a regular creature. Despite this, it would be offending to call them intelligent creatures, as they do not attack as a coherent unit even when they ambush something that has gained their ire.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Fire ants are, by comparison, more aggressive and magical counterpart of the giant ant. Developed from another ant species intentionally, it possesses abilities that giant ants do not have: ability to breathe fire.
	
	Easily recognizable from their red and orange color scheme, these vicious creatures do not make the slightest attempt to blend in, relying on both strength of numbers and their firebreath to singe everything they deem an obstacle. Once they enter an area, they will dedicate all of their power to build a nest -usually a large mound partially underground- and then eradicate all competition from the area. Due to this, it is rare to see different insects in an area with a large colony of fire ants.
	
	\bigskip
	Fire ants do usually use their firebreath only to fend for themselves, to keep safe distance from their enemy. For prey, mandibles are usually deemed good enough. The fire ants include much in their menu, including other insects such as radroaches and giant ants to brahmin, geckoes and jackalopes. They also include Cockatrice in their natural diet, as they are immune to Cockatrice's stone-turning stare, likely derived from their I.M.P. dip.
	
	Fire ant queens are different from giant ant queens in that they retain their wings even after birthing a colony's worth of workers and soldiers. This means that this highly aggressive mama can and will pursue their offender if other defenses for the nest fails. And much like any angry mother, she is relentless in her pursuit.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Firebush is a large plant that mostly inhabits marshes and wetlands. As it is a plant, it doesn't act with vindictive manner, mostly targeting moving creatures for the sake of spreading its seeds. The firebush requires an ashen ground to sprout properly and the plant has evolved with its mutations to ensure that. The seed pods contain a flammable oil that sets ablaze the moment it comes into contact with air when the fragile shell of the seed pod breaks. This chemical reaction causes an explosion that can be fatal. However, this is the plant's only harmful effect. In fact, the plant in question is downright harmless when the seeds have not developed yet.
	
	If one is able to collect the seed pods without breaking them, they can be made into makeshift bombs.

	If bothered, these small creatures quickly form a swarm, attacking in unison as if with a hivemind to dispose of any intruders. An unprepared gatherer can quickly find themselves engulfed by a swarm of yellow and blue -striped bees and stunned by them. Once they deem their source of annoyance neutralized, they usually cease attacking and return to their nest.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	It is not exactly clear from which plant the floaters mutated from - but it is clear that they're nasty plants nevertheless. While they are not very intelligent, they can be difficult to kill, especially if a group of them manages to surprise someone. 
	
	Floaters like to roam around in groups, and can potentially be found almost anywhere where there is living bodies to use as fertile ground for their pollen. Thus they especially can be found near where molerats are abundant.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Geckos are mutated lizards, regularly hunted for their durable hides. Before the War, they tended to be much smaller than a pony. Nowadays the largest geckos can easily stand taller than a griffin.
	
	Geckos have a characteristic pair of frills behind their head, which they fan out when they go for the attack. The gecko's eyes are strongly amber in hue, while the coloration of the hide depends on the subtype - normal ones being smokey gray or dark green, fire geckos' sporting a dark purple hide, and the golden gecko lives up to its name with its rich golden hue in the hide. 
	
	All geckos have sharp claws, and even sharper teeth, with which they'll strike against their prey or assailant. They charge or leap at their opponent, trying to snap onto any limb with their jaws, while not shying away from quick slashes with their claws to put down their enemy. Some sub-species of geckos have mutated with additional natural weapons at their disposal, utilizing them at first when in range.
	
	While geckos apparently lack a hierarchical structure, they still communicate amongst the packs they often create - said packs found easily in warmest climates, and hardly none where winters are prominent. A series of squeaks, chirps or coos create their ``language'', easily being heard to a moderate distance away. However, the pack of geckos is very tight - attacking one gecko will incur the wrath of the entire pack, and they will seek out the attacker. Geckos fight over the same terrain as salamanders, and often the latter comes on top.

		\textbf{Painless:} Ghosts feel no pain, and as such, do not suffer from Pain Thresholds.
		
		\textbf{Soul jar:} Ghosts are animated resemblances of the pony long dead inside an environmental suit. As such, the suit which contains the bound soul, cannot be killed and it repairs any damage it suffers. However, destroying the talisman frees the bound soul, thus exempting the ghost to the afterlife.
		
		\textbf{Self-Restoration:} Ghosts regain HP each turn and even restore severed limbs. Ghosts gain 2 HP per turn, and restore any limb in a single turn, except head in two turns. If ghost is reduced to 0 HP without destruction of the talisman, it restores half of its HP and all limbs in a single turn, but is unable to move. 
		
		\textbf{Pink Cloud Hazard:} Piercing the ghost's suit releases the Pink Cloud inside the suit on a Tiny Splash Template for two rounds. Because Ghosts are technically tiny containers, the Pink Cloud is concentrated in higher doses; Staying in this area removes 1 HP token per round from the target. Should the Ghost Sprint or Charge, they'll leave behind a line of Pink Cloud for 2 turns.
		
		\textbf{Rock:} As Ghosts embody the spirits of foals, they're often not familiar with weaponry, using whatever improvised weapons they can find and use the stats according to the size of the improvised weapon.
		
		\textbf{Poison Immunity:} Ghosts are immune to all toxins due to their status as unliving, necromantic entity.
		
		\textbf{Rad Immunity:} Because Ghosts are not alive, held together by the zebra talisman in their suit, they are immune to Radiation.
		
		\textbf{Talisman:} The Ghost can be freed into the afterlife by destroying the zebra talisman holding them together. Each attack made on the Ghost's torso is followed by a LCK -3 roll to see if the attack hit the talisman and destroyed it.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	While the term ``Ghost'' might make one think about ethereal, angry spirits hunting the mortal -which do, in fact, exist but rarely have as much effect as fiction would imply-, these ghosts only hold onto one common nominator with the ghosts seen in old mares' stories. They're definitely dead as dust. 
	
	Due to a unique feature -some would call this a glitch- of the P7 Mark VI life support suit's talisman that many foals were given when the bombs fell to shield them from radiation, the talisman instead made the foals into unliving creatures stuck in their suits. Most commonly known as Ghost Herd, this herd of unliving foals emerged a mere month after the bombs fell.
	
	\bigskip
	Extremely resilient to damage thanks to the Zebra talisman that binds their souls into the suit and repairs them, these poor creatures often went mad over their helpless quest to find their parents. Destroying this talisman frees the soul of the foal, allowing them the respite they've been due for 200 odd years.
	
	In the span of 200 years, the Ghosts fell into obscurity, becoming little more than a legend. Thus, it is reasonable that should one come across a Ghost, it will be a sight to remember.
	
	In battle, Ghosts are fairly simple as they are foals in mentality. Using whatever they have managed to pick up or find laying around to fend for themselves, they attack any living creature they come by, if they've been driven mad. Even the sane ones have poor understanding of morality or the harshness of the Wastes, not necessarily knowing what they're really doing.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Giant ants are one of the more common insects one can find in the Wastes, just behind radroaches. Dark in color and often travelling in bands of four or more, these insects camouflage well into their surroundings. 
	
	Much like regular, pin-sized ants, they often travel specific scent trails, and will attack anything that happened to get close enough. They use the scent trail to alert other giant ants and recruit more force to take down targets. Giant ants can carry several times their body weight, so it is not entirely uncommon to see a small group of giant ants carry off a brahmin corpse to their nest.
	Though giant ants can carry creatures big enough as ponies or brahmin, they usually hunt smaller prey; radroaches, geckoes, feral dogs, wood-rot wasps and radbits are more often on the giant ant's menu than ponies are. However, giant ants are aggressive and can attack a pony if they feel threatened.
	
	When fighting, the giant ant can spray formic acid at their foe from a moderate distance, or grab onto them with their mandibles, that have enough bite force to break bones. However, they are not well-suited for grappling, as giant ant's mandibles are quite small in size, when compared to its cousin, the fire ant.
	
	Giant ants build their nests in moist, dark places, and this nest is run by a queen. This queen is several times larger than her subjects, and rarely leaves the nest, unless the queen is new and is looking for a place to build a nest. During a time like this, a giant ant queen can be seen flying well above the treelines, matching the speed of an average pegasus. Queens that have already settled into a nest drop their wings.

		\textbf{Wasteland Weaponry:} Hellhounds can equip themselves with weaponry and armor. In addition, Hellhounds have 2 additional DT from their tough skin.
		
		\textbf{Bipedal Warriors:} As hellhounds can walk on their hind legs, they leave their forelegs free. As such, hellhounds can Switch, Ready, and Reload items and weapons with -1 AP less.
		
		\textbf{Long reach:} Hellhounds have considerably long forelegs, giving their Melee and Unarmed attacks additional 2 meters (1 Hex) reach.
		
		\textbf{Rend (4 AP):} The Hellhound's claws are sharp and capable of ripping apart metal and stone. The attack deals 4+(2) damage and ignores 4 DT.

		\textbf{Digger (3 AP):} Hellhounds can dig underground and travel distances unharmed, and pop up from the ground like very deadly daisies. They can move 10 meters/5 hex underground by using all of their AP, and resurfacing costs 0 AP.
		
		\textbf{Poison Resistant:} Hellhounds are used to various chemicals due to their history with Splendid Valley. They have poison resistance of 60.
		
		\textbf{Rad Resistant:} Hellhounds mutated from the combined effect of Taint and radiation, giving them acute radiation resistance of 60.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Hellhounds are without a doubt one of the most fearsome creatures in the Wasteland. They're mutated Diamond Dogs, sporting not only their intelligence but also sharpened claws - easily digging through dirt, rock and metal. These claws are their main weapon, though they do not shy away from scavenging any potential weaponry with destructive powers from their fallen enemies.
	
	Hellhounds still remember how ponies treated them during the Great War, and have passed that hatred to their offspring down the years. Thus when it comes to anyone with equine appearance, Hellhounds consider them good when they're in a shallow grave.
	
	Hellhounds typically form small, tight tribes, with alpha males at the head and the matriarch very close second. Both are respected in their communities, with the matriarch deciding many of the mundane survival, pup-rearing and education, while the alpha decides hunts and strategies.

		\textbf{Tight Grasp:} Hospital Horror's mouth tentacles make these abominations superb at grappling their enemies, thus they gain +10 to all opposed rolls made to Grapple.
		
		\textbf{Paralyzing Stare (7 AP):} Hospital Horror's eyes unleash a magical, spell-like reaction on anything it makes eye-contact with, stunning them. Target may try to resist locking eyes with the beast with a PER-2 roll, and a failed roll results in eye-contact. The target gets Stunned-status effect. Characters with sunglasses get no penalty on their PER roll.
		While the target is stunned, they may attempt an INT-2 roll to break out of their shock, once per turn.
		
		\textbf{Tentacle Slap (5 AP):} Hospital Horror can attack with its tentacles (Melee, reach of 2 meters (1 Hex)). This attack deals 1+(5) damage, and might knock the target prone. Target may resist being knocked prone with an END check.
		
		\textbf{Sickening:} When the Hospital Horror's flesh is cut, it emits a sickening, bitter stench from the wound, giving everyone within Small Splash template centered on it 1x50\% chance of being poisoned. This poison causes -1 SPECIAL damage to a randomly selected SPECIAL.
		
		\textbf{Poison Resistant:} This abomination is often found in hospitals -hence the name- surrounded by various chemicals. Because of this, they sport a rather high tolerance to poison, with their poison resistance at 50.
		
		\textbf{Rad Resistant:} Due to their close relation to Taint, Hospital Horrors are well-equipped against radiation. Their Radiation resistance is 80.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Hospital Horrors are horrifyingly mutated ponies, being one of the worst result one can experience when exposed to Taint. Now pale-skinned with gazing red eyes, it barely resembles a pony as it crawls across surfaces. The most striking feature that makes it stand out is the various tentacle-like appendages sprouting from its muzzle, swaying and latching at random.
	
	Hospital Horrors are often found, as their name implies, in abandoned medical centers of various kinds. What makes them to seek out these places is unknown, though it may be the small hint of sentience left in the pony to seek help.
	
	When Hospital Horrors see their prey, they first try to get a direct line of sight to them to use their horrifying and paralyzing gaze upon them before closing in to grasp the now-helpless creature with their tentacles. They often try to single out potential targets from a group, only attempting entire group directly when there's an overwhelming numbers of them.

		\textbf{Noxious Odors (6 AP):} The Hydra emits a foul stench, causing anyone within Large Splash template from it to suffer a poisoning with 2x50\% chance. When poisoned, the target suffers  a -2 to a random SPECIAL and no longer recovers Strain. Antivenom cures this effect.
		
		\textbf{Venomous Spit (5 AP):} Hydra salivates a thick and venomous spit (Melee, Range 10/20/40), that will cause 2+(5) damage. If any damage pierces the DT, the target has a chance to get poisoned with 2x50\% chance. When poisoned, the target suffers  a -2 to a random SPECIAL and no longer recovers Strain. 
		
		\textbf{Skull Bash (4 AP):} Hydra slams one of its head down, potentially cracking its opponent to pieces. This attack will cause 2+(3) damage, and has a reach of 4 meters / 2 hexes. This attack has a 10 \% base Cripple chance when making Called Shots. If this attack misses and the head bashes against the ground, the head in question takes 1 HP damage and gets stunned.
		
		\textbf{Swallow Whole (7 AP):} Due to its size, the hydra can easily swallow a pony whole. If the Hydra wins an opposed roll of the Hydra's STR against the target's AGI, the target is swallowed whole. Allies then have 3 turns to try and cut the corresponding head to get the target out.
		
		\textbf{*Multiple Heads:} Hydra grows two more heads as one has been Crippled, giving the creature more sources to attack with; the hydra's AP is 10 + the number of heads it has. New heads spring out on the Hydra's next turn after Crippling blow. A hydra ignores any Crippled head penalties it gains, and it ignores any damage done to its heads. However, it loses 1 HP whenever a head is Crippled.
		
		\textbf{Poison Resistant:} Hydra has a poison resistance of 40.
		
		\textbf{Rad Immunity:} For reasons ponykind can only speculate on, Hydras are immune to radiation damage.
		
		\textbf{Chilled:} Due to its reptilian nature, hydra has a weakness towards Cold. Cold damage is doubled on this creature.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Hydra is a large and relatively intelligent mythological creature that is, for the relief of many Wastelanders, quite a rare sight. Opting for wet marshes and wetlands, this creature can hide under the murky swamp waters, awaiting prey to pass by.
	
	Mean-spirited and definitely one to laugh at misfortune, this creature's many heads can rarely agree on anything, and tend to argue amongst themselves. However, should they manage to catch their victim, they can swallow them whole, granted the victim is smaller than the Hydra.
	
	\bigskip
	The hydra's heads can regenerate when cut, opting for two new heads to pop in their place. In addition, their body odor leaves much to be desired, as they tend to emit a foul stench. Their scaly body is also quite sturdy, able to withstand attacks.
	
	However, their reptilian bodies also prove their greatest weakness as cold climate and weaponry can render the hydra stiff and sluggish, quickly leading to its demise. Due to this, they are more commonly found in the southern regions of the Equestrian Wasteland.
	To counter the cold-generating weaponry ponies have developed, the hydra has a poisonous spit that seeps through by skin contact. 
	
	Though hydra do not seem to be as magical as say, timberwolves, they do resist the effects of magical radiation, having kept them largely the same over the two centuries. Many have attempted to find the reason for this, as it is not immediately apparent, evidence seems to point to their highly developed liver filtering out both toxins and radiation.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Jackalopes and their larger, more aggressive variant, Al-Miraj, are horned rabbits; Jackalopes with deer horns and Al-Mi'raj with spiraling unicorn horn. What sets them apart from Radbits is their affinity to weave spells from the same energy Unicorns harness theirs, and their intelligent behavior. Both Jackalopes and Al-Mi'raj are able to employ tactics and are known to attack as an efficient group.
	
	Most Jackalope colonies consist of Jackalopes exclusively, but every once in a while an Al-Mi'raj is born. This Al-Mi'raj will quickly gain leadership of the herd due to their superior intellect and magical prowess. Jackalope and Al-Mi'raj have an ability to mimic sounds, though they do not actually speak, even if they are capable of, to some extent, figure out cause and effect of certain words to lure prey.
	
	Both variants are cunning and aggressive, swarming their target en-masse from all sides if their spells prove inefficient. They could also be considered dirty fighters, as they tend to use every advantage they can have to their benefit and spare not even the most horrifying of spells if it assures them a meal. It should be noted, that though ferocious, Jackalopes rarely kill without need. Though particularly intelligent individuals can seem almost sadistic when they kill.
	
	\bigskip
	Al-Mi'raj are particularly fierce hunters, rarely backing out of a fight unless it proves to soon turn fatal for them. Unlike rabbits, Jackalopes are entirely carnivorous creatures.
	
	Colonies are usually large, and exhibit many behaviors that a regular rabbit does; burrows are used for nests, and with strict hierarchy. These burrows are often fiercely guarded from predators, with spells finding their target long before one sees the long-ears of the Jackalope. Blood and gore often mars the entries of these burrows, likely as a warning sign to predators of things to come.

		\textbf{Bite (6 AP):} Manticore's jaws are strong enough to crack bones. This attack deals 4+(3) damage, and has a 20\% base chance of Crippling the limb it bites.
		
		\textbf{Swipe (7 AP):} Manticore can swipe at their targets with their massive paws. This attack deals 2+(3) damage, and can knock the target prone. This can be resisted with an Opposed STR roll.
		
		\textbf{Stinger (6 AP):} The manticore's stinger contains a potent venom that slows down its victim, numbing their limbs. The attack deals 1+(4) damage, and has a 2x50\% chance of poisoning the target. If poisoned, the target's movement actions cost +2 AP extra.
		
		\textbf{Flying:} Manticore have working wings, though they are rather poor fliers, due to preferring thick forests over open plains. Their flight speed is 2 meters (1 Hex) for 2 AP.
		
		\textbf{Poison Resistant:} Manticores' bodies contain natural toxins due to their scorpion-like tail. These toxins further improve their ability to resist other poisons, giving them poison resistance of 50.
		
		\textbf{Rad Immunity:} Manticores possess natural immunity to radiation.
		
		\textbf{Taint Immunity}: Manticores are one of the rare creatures immune to Taint, and its effects.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Manticores are large mythical beasts with the face, poofy mane and body of a lion, the tail of a scorpion and a pair of leathery wings. Easily an apex predator of any area they claim for themselves, there are only a few creatures that actively hunt Manticores. Though they are not usually aggressive enough to attack on sight, male manticores have been known to attack creatures that end up in their turf during mating season. The females turn aggressive when they have cubs to protect.
	
	If threatened, Manticore will defend its domain with the fury of an angered lion. They swoop down on their target, attempting to poison them with their stinger before landing on the ground. If forced to fight in the air, they resort to their strong claws instead to knock their enemy down to the ground first.
	
	Manticores are - somehow - immune to the effects of radiation, having survived through the years without any mutations. 
	
	Like previously stated, Manticores are carnivores. Their strong jaws are large enough to generate enough force to shatter bones. Thus they don't leave any carcass behind that would attract unwanted attention to their turf. As territorial creatures, the Manticore's lair can be recognized by the stomach-churning stench of musk, often compared to the smell of rotting eggs. The manticore's lair is usually located in a tree or a ledge, where it can easily see around for a considerable distance and where their offspring are safe.

		\textbf{Wasteland Weaponry:} Mercenaries can carry just about any weapon and armor imaginable, and usually prefer bigger and heavier hitting guns and heavy armor.
		
		\textbf{Greedy:} Mercenaries work for the highest paying clients, and thus, striking a deal better than their current assignment can turn their heads to look a way.
		
		\textbf{Organized:} Mercenaries have hierarchy of leadership. They strike as units and groups of various sizes, usually under at least one commander. Eliminating such commander often leaves rest of the team at disarray and demoralized.
		
		\textbf{Poison Resistant:} Mercenaries are most commonly ponies, zebras or griffins, thus they have their resistances reflecting this. They have Poison Resistance of 10 (20 if they are Zebras). Equipped armor can change these numbers.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Mercenaries are the paid guardsponies of the wastes, putting their life on the line to protect their employer's belongings and life. So long as the payment for the job lines up with the risks about to be taken.
	
	Sometimes mercenaries band together, forming their own little factions. Be it Talon Company or some band of misfits, all mercenaries have one thought above anything else: caps. Some mercenary groups put their morals aside for the payment - even selling out their employers if the caps so say, while others keep themselves in line and stick to the contract. Before dealing with such large groups - or even individuals - it is best to check where their loyalty stands.
	
	Mercenaries can be found almost anywhere in the wastes, but they most often linger close to where the payment can be easily achieved. These are large settlements, or potentially dangerous stretches of the road. Some large groups may even build their own little fortresses to house their operations at.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Mister Hoofies are utility robots with advanced artificial intelligence, created by Robronco to serve as robotic servants in the households. With this in mind, Mister Hoofies possess a few robotic claws to lift and move items, as well as two special extended arms - one with a circular buzzsaw, and the other with a smaller version of a flamethrower. While originally added to the robot as a help in the kitchen, it can - and will - use the special arms to combat ``intruders''.
	
	Their militarized version, Sir Gallant, packs a heavier punch and armor than its civilian counterpart. In addition to the buzzsaw and flamethrower - this time applied with combat in mind for the Equestrian Armed Forces - it packs a more accurate ranged weapon alongside the flamer, a plasma pistol. With these additions and combat preference in mind, Sir Gallant's behaviour and mannerisms are more patriotic and military-oriented, easily marking anyone who crosses it as a ``traitor''. 
	
	\bigskip
	Both Mister Hoofies and Sir Gallants usually roam the areas of their previous owners, doing their usual tasks like before the Great War. Some have, in time, gone haywire and began wandering the wasteland aimlessly, attacking without provocation. Most that have retained their artificial intelligence have moved on with their lifes, like ponies themselves, easily found in settlements as helpers and assistants.

	With the ability to burrow, they use this to their advantage - closing in on their target underground and then climbing up at their target, provided they note the vibrations of their steps.
	
	With the tendency to live in caves created by themselves, molerats can be found anywhere with sturdy enough soil to dig through. They don't shy away from making nests in old buildings either, as it saves digging time while providing superb shelter.

		\textbf{Shapeshift (3 AP):} Black Fungus can change its shape into other creatures it has consumed in the past, gaining their abilities but not their stats. They cannot cast magic, even if the creature consumed could.
		
		\textbf{Bloated:} Upon death, Black Fungus Shamblers explode releasing a cloud of poisonous pollen on a Small Splash template, with a 2x40 \%  chance to cause a poisonous effect. If the pollen is inhaled, the target will suffer a -1 to both END and AGI until the pollen is removed from the system, via Clean-spell or by visiting a doctor. If left untreated, both END and AGI continue to drop by 1 each day. If a target's END reaches 0 due to the pollen, they are turned into a Black Fungus Shambler.
		
		\textbf{Fire Weakness:} Black Fungus Shambler are weak against Heat and Fire damage. Moss Shamblers take double the damage against Heat and Fire damage.
		
		\textbf{Poison Resistant:} As fungus-animal hybrid, Black Fungus Shamblers are immune to poisons other than mycocides. Against mycocides, Black Fungus Shamblers have poison resistance of 30.
		
		\textbf{Rad Resistant:} As Black Fungus are radiation mutated fungus, their high Rad Resistance allows them to bloom in highly radiated areas. Their Rad Resistance is 60.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Moss Shambler begins its life-cycle as spores that infect hay and grain that equines eat. Once the spores reach the equine's stomach and intestines, it begins to grow, causing abdominal pain and general weakness of limbs. As the spores grow, the pony grows weaker and feeble, until they eventually die. After this, the spores take over their host's corpse, slowly pushing through the decaying flesh to form a fluffy mold fleece on the body.
	
	\bigskip
	Being plants, Moss Shamblers aren't the brightest in the world, acting on mere instincts. They attack any potential threat - or victim - with all they have, not stopping until either side has died or fled. And the Moss Shambler doesn't retreat. Likewise, the Moss Shambler doesn't have much goals in life; they seek only to infect ponies or grain, keeping the vicious cycle going. After releasing their spores onto the victim or the potential victim's hay, the Moss Shambler withers away, leaving behind little more than rotting pieces of flesh and bone. Due to the method they use to reproduce, a single Moss Shambler can cause untold destruction to entire settlements unless caught quickly.
	
	Moss Shamblers prefer humid areas when in the corpse-possessing state, keeping itself hydrated as it seeks a target to infect. It steers away from extreme temperatures, often seeking some sort of shelter if such falls upon it - thus one can find Moss Shamblers hidden away in somewhat intact ruins amidst freezing winter or scorching summers.
	
	\bigskip
	Black Fungus Shamblers are related to the Moss Shambler, though they are drastically different in behavior and hunting method; unlike Moss Shambler, the Black Fungus Shambler doesn't infect ponies, but lays dormant on trees, waiting for a creature to pass by. They then spring into action, chasing down the creature and engulfing them in the fungus, devouring the creature in seconds. The fungus can copy the creature's form and abilities, to better catch prey. There is nary a limit on the size the Black Fungus Shambler can engulf.
	
	After the Black Fungus Shambler has finished its dinner, it will retreat back onto the tree and begin to lay dormant until a new creature wanders too close.

		\textbf{Squash (8 AP):} At close range, Myling Queens can move their enormous bodies to squash targets near them. The squash deals 4+(4) damage, plus additional (1) for each size category smaller than them. Targets smaller than them must make an AGI or STR check, or be Pinned Down under the Myling Queen. 
		
		\textbf{Near Immobility:} Myling Queen's legs have nearly ceased all movement under their enormously heavy body. Myling Queens move at a pace of 2 meters (1 Hex) for 3 AP.

	Mylings are most commonly found in areas with prominent amount of Taint, as the queen's mutations have rendered them immobile. While the queen and a selected few myling drones tend to the multiple eggs the queen lays in the span of few days, the rest of the drones spread out in look for prey.
	
	\bigskip
	Myling Drones are about the size of a pony, and can disguise themselves like their unmutated kin, to throw off suspicion and lure in prey, which is sentient creatures. Once the prey has wandered close enough, the drones attack in a group of 3-4, stinging the prey until they fall to the ground, paralyzed by the myling's toxins. The myling drones then proceed to drag the paralyzed but conscious body back to their nest and encase the body in a transparent, green cocoon. 
	
	These cocoons' chemical compounds pacify the prey inside and allow for the cocoon to produce the prey's emotions and life energy into a food source for the myling. Once the sentient creature has been sucked dry, which can take up to a month, the cocoon is split open and the empty, mummified husk falls off to the ground. It is not known if mylings make an effort to remove these husks from their nest. 
	Despite this, myling presence is difficult to detect by smell, as the husks are noticeably more odorless than rotting carcasses.
	
	\bigskip
	Myling hives are the easiest to recognize from the faint green glow of the cocoons, which often litter the place entirely, with most dense concentration of cocoons near the queen's lair.
	
	Mylings, due to their close proximity with Taint, can sometimes form symbiotic relationships with other abominations, using them as ``attack dogs'' and guardians to the hive. Though it should be mentioned that Hospital Horrors they attack on sight, likely due to rivalry in prey.

		\textbf{Combustion (7 AP):} One of the innate abilities the magical Puckwudgie has is the ability to create grenade-like explosions around it. The attack is a Tiny Splash Template, with the range of 10/20/40 meters. The attack deals 2+(2) damage and follows the rules for explosives.
		
		\textbf{Shadow-Walker (5 AP, 5 Strain):} The Puckwudgie can turn invisible for short period of time; After activating this skill, they turn invisible for the rest of their current turn and their next turn. They return visible at the end of their next turn. If the creature takes damage while invisible, they will become visible again. Characters that try to spot the invisible Puckwudgie have -50 to their roll.
		
		\textbf{Poisonous Barb (4 AP):} In case the Puckwudgie finds itself out of Strain and too far from its enemies to attack with a Combustion, it turns its back towards enemy and launches the spikes from its back towards their enemy. However, their aim with this attack is poor and they suffer -10 to their Melee-skill when using this attack. This attack deals 2+(2) damage (range 20/40/80), and has a 2x60\% chance of poisoning their target. When successfully poisoned, the poison negates target's Strain recovery until healed. This poison is a long-lasting effect.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Puckwudgies are small, multicolored creatures that resemble bipedal hedgehogs. Often appearing in small groups, these spellcasting creatures can be annoying to deal with. However, unless they manage to catch their opponent by surprise, they're rarely deadly, preferring to give their target a good scare, as they are somewhat malicious in their nature.
	
	Mostly carnivorous, these creatures do not turn down an occasional pony or two, if they manage to bring one down. As they are intelligent creatures, but not satient, they operate on a language of their own, and are capable of planning strategies. This includes retreat when things take a turn for the worse in combat. Capable of ambush tactics and stalking, Puckwudgies can tail their target for kilometers at the time, staying on their target's heels with ease.
	
	To summarize, the Puckwudgie is most commonly a mean-spirited tactician than a fighter, preferring to use their magic from afar over their rather feeble strength.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Quarray Eels are huge, red-shaded eels that dwell inside rocky holes, waiting to lunge at a possible prey. As they're quite stationary, they have developed a slowed metabolism that allows them to go without nutrients for several years, perhaps even a decade. However, also due to this stationary nature, they usually take anything that wanders close enough as their prey, be it a radbit, pony, griffon or manticore.
	
	They are relatively sneaky creatures, and can on occasion, surprise their victims by sneaking their heads behind the creature and gulping them up, if the victim remains unaware of their surroundings.
	
	Quarray eels' burrows can be even a kilometer long, and any offspring -Quarray eels' mating habits are a mystery- seem to branch off further into the rocky terrain they call home, likely to keep food sources from going scarce.
	
	These eels inhabit any large cliff, mountain or canyon, anything big enough to support their weight. They have been found in the warmer outskirts of Equestrian north, burrowing through frozen rock and soil with relative ease.

	They aren't, however, completely harmless creatures. With the tendency to breed like rabbits - because they are - they quickly form large herds if the food is plenty. It is not unheard of a large swarm of radbits consuming all the produce of an unprotected wasteland farm field. There is a very good reason why farmers carry shotguns, even after the world's end.
	
	Radbits tend to stick to temperate climates, and any semblance of woodlands if possible. With a good spot found, they quickly burrow a nest - that sprawls out with the growing radbit population as time goes by. It has been documented that the largest mega-swarm's burrow spanned several kilometers in length.

They don't want to eat you, but they sure as hell want you away from their turf. I know, because my geiger's beeping like crazy, and they're OUTSIDE the building. Wonderful!''}

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Rad-Butterflies are a mutated butterfly, that is largely harmless on their own. However, when they migrate as they travel in large swarms, the radioactive dust on their wings can quickly down a pony with radiation poisoning if they happen to engulf them.
	
	Rad-Butterflies are one of the few creatures that do not have ponies in their diet, as they, much like non-mutated butterflies, live entirely off of nectar and liquids. They can feed on pony's sweat or blood, but that is rare and seems to be reserved for times of famine. This can sometimes lead to a wastelander's demise, if a migrating swarm takes a pit stop on them.
	
	Rad-Butterflies migrate south-east, to the borders of Abyssinia. Rad-Butterflies fare poorly in the cold, so they're noticeably lacking in the more arid temperatures of the Equestrian north.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Radhogs are the result of Equestria's many pigs gaining a radioactive bath after the Last Day. Though initially rare, the mutations eventually made the Equestrian suid a force to be reckoned and numerous to boot.
	
	Radhogs have a scraggy, coarse fur that usually hangs in patches, with inflamed, reddish-colored flesh spotting the creature. They have long, slightly curved tusks on their mouth and a keen sense of smell with their smushed snout. The Radhog's diet is that of an omnivore; meat, roots, berries, insects, eggs and an occasional equine or griffon that wanders too close.
	
	Radhogs are social creatures, which makes hunting them especially dangerous, as they will attack the pony as a group. Just shy of a general mare's height and several times heavier, they can easily knock a pony down. Their long tusks can also cause serious injuries. 
	In addition, the radhogs have a vicious temper, known to be unpredictable at best. If one comes across a radhog unprepared, the wisest move is to slowly back away, to not startle the creature. And even then it can add the poor sod to their ``Things I do not like today'' list on a whim.
	
	They are also relatively hardy creatures, often shrugging off bullet wounds, and several are unfortunately often needed to down this mighty boar.

	Radrels, the other leaping rodents beside radbits, are quite perfect practice for starting hunters due to their small size, and both excellent and fast maneuvers through the branches, bushes and ruins of all sorts. They startle easily, and do flee as long as they can. Still, those sharp teeth can deal nasty wounds if push comes to shove.
	
	A radrel bears enough meat for the day, and few pelts are perfect for warming one's hooves. But a truly devious hunter will wait till the radrel reveals it's stash. Having mutated and adapted, the radrel is omnivorous, but also a collector, that stashes food away for later use.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	What is an apocalypse without the surviving cockroach? Worthless. Just like the radroach. This mutated insect has retained most if not all behavior cues from their non-mutated brethren, such as preferring dark over light, being nocturnal social creatures and are generally disgusting to most sentient creatures.
	
	Radroaches are relatively timid creatures, only attacking if they've been provoked, and tend to run away from light-sources. Radroaches are usually considered an annoying, dirty pest rather than a threat to one's health, though radroaches can contaminate one's food-supply with their fecal matter.
	
	However, despite their initial weakness, they are suited to most environments and adapt well into their surroundings. Aside from the freezing northern-Equestria near the Crystal Empire, radroaches are a common sight. 
	
	Magical radiation rarely bothers them much, neither do toxins. Radroaches are omnivores to the extreme, eating anything from soiled clothes, to skin flakes, corpses, paper, meat and vegetables to name a few. Due to their hefty size, they consume a lot of nutrients and a swarm of radroach can easily destroy a warehouse's worth of food or building materials if left untreated.
	
	Should a radroach be threatened enough to attack, they will do so by biting their target. They often jump and skitter on the target, trying to find a suitable spot. This is often quite intense for those that dislike these critters.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Radscorpions are the mutated, wandering scorpions that due to their heightened survivability, have left the barren badlands of the southern Equestria to become a common sight in all but the most northern parts of the Wastes.
	
	Though an old saying tells that the most dangerous scorpions are the smallest ones, the radscorpion has clearly missed the memo. It is huge and armed with potent, necrotic poison that kills the cells in the body, making recovery nigh-impossible unless cured with an antidote. 
	Due to this, radscorpions rarely kill their victims outright, but rather prefer to follow them, inflicting wounds when the target is letting their guard down to whittle down the target. Eventually, the poor sod will succumb to their wounds and keel over, giving the Radscorpion what they hoped for; a sufficient meal.
	
	However, on occasion radscorpions can come across the same prey, which then becomes a race of which scorpion can down the victim first, technically winning the right to food. Of course, this rarely ends peacefully, as the losing radscorpion can wrestle the winner for the spoils. These wrestling matches have something of a gentlecolt's conduit attached to them, as no stinger is used. Usually the loser of the wrestling match crawls away in shame.
	
	Radscorpions eat most insects, mammals and on occasion, each other, steering clear of the Hellhounds, robots and most plant-based mutants as all of these creatures offer little to no nutritional value to the Radscorpion, or are too much effort and dangerous to face.
	
	Radscorpions are solitary creatures, only tolerating each others' companionship when mating or carrying offspring. And in the case of mating, the deed is done quickly and parting even quicker, unless the male wishes to become the female's next meal.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Radstags, the ghoul variant of the many deer communities that inhabited the vast Equestrian forests, are often considered the unwilling victim of the war. Caught between the warring Equestria and the Zebra nation, the deer considered themselves neutral in the conflict. For all good that it did for them, once the balefire missiles rained down.
	
	Radstags mutated by aforementioned balefire, growing an extra head and extra legs. Their legs are long and thin, little more than sticks that protrude from their patchy furred body. Their antlers vary in size, with one head having a larger set than the other, likely so they do not tangle. Their antlers glow green in the dark, making them easier to spot during the night.
	
	The mental state of the mutated deer suffered greatly by the necromantic magic that drove most, if not all, of the now-named radstags to madness. Now little more than animals working on basic instinct, these pitiful souls flee from anything they perceive as a threat. They rarely fend for themselves, but it is known that during mating season, the bucks get highly aggressive, enough to overcome their usual timid nature and attack anything in a blind rage.
	
	Should they end up in a fight anyway, they will trample and buck their foes in order to daze them enough to make an escape attempt from the situation. Though deer were notorious for their nature magic and concoctions used to tend to their forest homes, but this magic has been lost with the radstag.

	Raiders are one of the more mix-match groups that wander the Wastes, though most common race is a pony for the sheer fact that ponies often outnumber the other races.
	
	Raiders are known for their penchant for horrid, over-the-top violent acts such as stringing corpses to ceilings, mutilating both corpses and the living alike. Reasons why raiders behave as they do are difficult to pinpoint, as some attest it to the heavy use of alcohol and drugs, while others suggest a special brain disease that turns them hostile and yet another claims desperate situation and higher susceptibility to mental illnesses. 
	
	Raiders are often violent towards both outsiders and those in their own group they view weak or inferior. Due to this, raiders are rather lackluster group who listen to one person only; themselves. Raider initiation rituals are quite savage, including severe beatings and dangerous doses of drugs. 
	A considerably strong individual can rise to the rank of a raider overboss, the de-facto leader of the group by being stronger and more menacing than the rest of the group. This will however mean that said individual will always be doomed to keep their guard up, lest they be taken down from their position by power-hungry usurpers.
	
	Though is is easy to imagine that raiders value physical strength only, there have been instances where a particularly brutal and cunning unicorns has risen in the ranks all the way to overboss-status. It could be said that on some level, raiders approve all kind of power, be it brawn, magic or high intelligence, if it can be put to good use.
	
	In combat, raiders prefer to attack head-on, trying to overwhelm their opponents with numbers, and use combat drugs such as Dash and Stampede to their advantage. Their use of drugs have left them unpredictable, but they do still have a sense of self-preservation; when things start to turn bad for them, they will attempt to flee.

	Robobrain was a solution for the problem of creating a robot with perfect artificial intelligence - by installing a brain of a pony or other sentient being as the central processing unit, housed in a preservative gel to not decay faster than the robot's metallic exterior. 
	
	While a feat of genius, and successful in its own right, the project had some limitations - of both moral and design variety. Brains had to be extracted from living or recently deceased individuals to have minor chances of malfunction, and even then the sudden change may have proven detrimental to the now-mechanical being's mental health. And when those malfunctions occured, it proved to make the robobrains mad. No pun intended. 
	
	Robobrains roam the wastes aimlessly, seeking something to do - or patrol the areas where they were stationed as assistants and general help, working away still after all the years. Most models have been created with speakers attached, providing a way for the long-deceased owner of the brain-turned-CPU to speak his or her mind. That is, if they haven't suffered a major malfunction already.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Salamanders are lizards, capable of not only withstanding flames but able to spout them. Their characteristic red or orange hide, marked with dark spots along their back easily stands out amidst the remnants of green. While still in their hatchling stage, they're nothing more than a pest, and often an adorable one, being much smaller than your average pony while only managing to spout small flares. Once they grow to adulthood, however, the cuteness dissipates - easily towering over ponies, they defend their territory fiercely, often with their trademark flame spit. And they  consider ponies to be part of their diet.
	
	Salamanders are a common pest species in more arid environments of the Equestrian Wasteland, having taken a liking to various ruins left behind by ponies. Salamanders keep their hide in check by staying warm, and best way they achieve this is by creating small fires wherever they go. They do fight over same territory with geckos, and often where there is one species, the other is nowhere to be found. It is, however, often the salamanders who come out on top if the two species duke it out.

		\textbf{Corrupting Touch (8 AP):} The Shade merges with the target's shadow, giving all of the target's actions +1 AP penalty. For each full round the Shade is merged in a shadow, the target removes a HP token, ignoring DT, on the Shade's turn. Shade can still attack targets other than the one it has merged with, with the Enfeebling Touch. Bright light, such as casting Light or complete darkness forces the Shade to abandon their target's shadow. 
		
		\textbf{Unliving:} Shades pass through solid, non-magical objects like incorporeal ghosts. Due to this, conventional, non-magical weapons do not harm them. Magical weaponry like MEWs and Spirits do. They also cannot be killed per say, but if their HP is brought to a 0, they are dispersed for a day after which they reform themselves.
		
		\textbf{Painless:} Shades feel no pain, and as such, do not suffer from Pain Thresholds.
		
		\textbf{Poison Immunity:} As shades can hardly be considered alive, they are naturally immune to poisons.
		
		\textbf{Rad Immunity:} Due to the necromantic energies that sustain the shade, they are very well adapted to irradiated areas, even ground zero. They are immune to the effects of Radiation.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	A living shadow. That's what common folk tell stories about. And for the same common folk, it's a description perfect enough. A shade's a moving, seemingly instinct-following shadow of truly vile necrotic nature. But it is in all manners of science, a non living entity.
	
	Shades are - for the simplicity of words - born from the grand overdose of Radiation burning the victim's shadow, and part of it's essence by all knowledge gathered so far, permanently to the place they perished. 
	
	The terrors shades can bring upon even for the most careful of travellers, are nigh undetectable while lying in wait of even smallest of shadows, striking their prey both at the body, and at the shadow they cast. The touch of a shade feels like being burned with a frozen flame within but maybe more terrifying is the possibility of a shade taking possession of one's own shadow, and by that their whole body. And while shades are often limited to the place of their birth, the place can be anything from a small hut, to a huge mansion, a garden or a castle.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Slavers aren't quite as mad as raiders, but more ruthless and greedy than mercenaries. Their main source of income and life is to rush into unsuspecting or undefended homes and settlements, take any or all ponies they can, and sell them away to some immoral wastelander who needs cheap workforce. Or something else.
	
	As such, slavers are widely despised and often not bargained with by more civilized folks. This drives these ``wasteland entrepreneurs'' to stick to their own groups and form their own camps and fortresses. They do not, however, barricade themselves in, making excursions to the wastes to keep up their lifestyle and ``might makes right'' mentality.
	
	Unlike Raiders who often act in a lackluster manner, slavers do keep a relatively tight hierarchy and organization for maximum efficiency and profit. Yet, one could say that a particularly nasty slaver is willing to sell anypony, friendships and history be damned.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	In old days, snakes would vary between size of a hoof, and two griffons. However, small ones would often be highly venomous, while large snakes would constrict their prey to death. Sometimes the prey can be several sizes larger than the snake, yet the snake will swallow the prey whole. Known to be loners, snakes would only be seen in groups during mating seasons, and as mad collector's pets.
	
	As Wasteland was born, magical residue would transform many snakes completely twisting the belief only small snakes are venomous, as snakes would be commonly the size of an average pony. But what truly remarkable happened, was the splitting; snakes would become twin - or even tri-headed, multiplying the killing force against the fresh prey of the Wastes.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Spiders haven't changed much since the bombs fell - their most striking change being the large size they've grown to. 
	
	Depending on the spider, they may produce a web in shady corners or between two standing posts, burrow underground and stalk for any passing pray, or fill a large cavity in ruins with webs to call it home. Whatever the case, they're always hunting for meat. And ponies aren't an exception on their menu.
	
	The magical radiation hasn't exactly calmed down these creatures either; they tend to attack any suitable prey, should they be hungry or feeling threatened. However, much like any animal, they're smart enough to flee when things get dicey for them.
	
	Spiders are often loners by nature, with the exception of a female with an egg sac or mating season. And for the male spider, that can end in death as well.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Spider-Bots resemble normal spiders a lot - they have eight mechanical legs for stability, and various sensors on the center part to detect movement and life. Over the years, the number of legs may have dropped by one or two, though that won't hinder their movement.
	
	Spider-Bots were created as a cheap, mobile yet effective defense mechanism for various commercial uses. Mimicking their more insect cousins, Spider-Bots carry around an arsenal of sedatives to utilize on ``trespassers'', as well as shocking ability and ranged magical attack for the more troublesome ``hoodlums''. 
	
	Spider-Bots are programmed as purely defensive, and thus do not roam the wastes at all. Instead, they stay in and around the very building they were assigned to, protecting it from any danger, be it a mutated animal or scavenger.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	One of the more freakish mutations the Wastes has to offer, the Spore carrier is a pony overtaken by a transformative pollen. Though the pony itself is long dead, the flower infested corpse shambles around with some strange semblance of pony behavior. Once the Spore carrier itself dies - through age or wasteland weaponry - it may sprout a new Spore Plant to continue the cycle.
	
	Spore carriers, much like ponies, are social creatures that form tight groups. There is usually a stronger alpha to lead a herd of spore carriers, sometimes called ``Spore Carrier Princess''. Due to this herd-mentality, they tend to attack in groups as well.
	
	Spore carriers are ambush-predators, hiding in vegetation until the victim has walked close enough for a quick surprise attack. When Spore carriers attack, they use both their long claw-like spikes and poisonous barbs to render the victim unconscious. The Spore carrier will then release the same transformative pollen on the victim, who will, if left untreated, turn into a Spore carrier themselves. 
	
	Generally, this transformation takes few weeks, with first symptoms showing up within a few days. The symptoms include shortness of breath, dizziness, orange spots appear on the body and finally, the victim's body starts to gain bark-like properties, before death takes them. 
	
	Thankfully, there is a cure for the affliction; a potion made of the Spore plant's sap and few Green herbs boiled in water takes care of the pollen when digested for every day about a week.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	A result of a biological experiment gone horribly wrong after - or before - the Great War, the Spore Plant has become a nuisance in the Wasteland. Its method of multiplying relies on its spores getting inhaled by a passing being, who then slowly turns into a Spore Carrier. The Spore Carriers act also as a defending horde against anyone who dares too close to the Spore Plant. It is common to find one with the other nearby.
	
	Spore plants are rooted in place, thus they cannot pursue. However, they can use toxic barbs to shoot at far-away targets, which compels the poisoned target to become enraged. This is all in purpose of luring the victim closer for eventual pollination.
	
	These swamp plants are quite unique with how well they fare with radiation, as they are actually healed by it. Thus the Spore Plants thrive in damp swamps contaminated by fallout, and may occasionally be found in slightly flooded buildings.

	\subsection*{Description}
	The Sprite-Bots are basically hovering little balls of metal, closely resembling the unmutated parasprite in exterior view. Their exact original use is unknown, but all models are equipped with a speaker, microphone and radio antenna, allowing for listening and sending messages on radio waves, as well as some sort of self-defence weapon, usually small-caliber firearm or magical weaponry. These features make the Sprite-Bot a great companion for those with knowledge on robotics - that is, if they find one that isn't either hostile or already in use by some wastelander broadcasting annoying music.
	
	Because Sprite-Bots do not usually have a defense protocol assigned to a specific building, it is common to find a Sprite-Bot wandering about in the Wastes. Due to at least seeming to be a civilian contraption and one never meant for active combat, Sprite-Bots are rather easy to hack and gain access to, when compared to a nigh-invulnerable Ultra-Sentinel.

	While originally the Steel Rangers' oath was to the protection of Equestrian populace, their goals have shifted to the acquisition and research of advanced pre-War technology in the hopes they may duplicate it. This drive for technology adds to their immersive arsenal of weaponry - often making encounters with them highly risky if one has something the Rangers are after.
	
	The Rangers' command structure is hierarchical and extremely rigid. A commanding officer can only issue commands to their direct subordinate, and a commanding officer's orders should not be questioned. At the top of every chapter of Steel Rangers sits an Elder, whose words are final.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Star-Spawn is one of the most threatening creatures the Equestrian Wasteland has ever seen. Often doing terrible damage to its surroundings simply by walking through a settlement or by sitting down to take a nap.
	
	Gargantuan in size, these star-patterned bears hail from the pre-war Equestrian Ursa Major, a mythological bear with a see-through body of stars. In fact, the changes to this creature are nearly non-existing; aside from the slight increase to size and more see-through body, little has changed in the Star-Spawn. These creatures are quite difficult to take down due to their nearly invisible body, and their size and strength.
	
	Linked to many zebra myths, these bears are the ultimate ill omen for a zebra tribe, as their star-patterns are seen as something beyond evil incarnate, feared by many. Thankfully, star-spawn territories can easily span half a country, meaning that it is quite rare to run into one.
	
	Star-Spawn are solitary creatures, but their females are noticeably caring mothers, caring for their offspring well beyond their infant years. The cub is a curious thing, eventually beginning to wander off from their nest and usually end up in some poor settlement when taking a stroll.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Tankbugs are one of the few creatures in this book that do not usually intend to do harm on sentient creatures, as they are strictly herbivores, eating mostly rotting plant material. However, their massive, bus-sized bodies can cause harm on accident, as they can run ponies over. In addition, they secrete chemicals when they feel threatened, but these chemicals are often easy to avoid, due to forming in pools. These chemicals can burn on skin-contact, have a foul smell and can stain the coat and fabric of a pony a shade of purple. Due to these chemicals staining properties, Tankbug secretions have been used to dye clothes in Wastes, for all those two equines that care about such trivial matters.
	
	Tankbug shells are exceptionally hardy, making them rather difficult to kill. Due to this, some folks use Tankbug shells as makeshift barriers and lodging.

		\textbf{Coward:} Thugs are not necessarily the most capable fighters, and tend to run away at the first sign of the fight going south. Thugs have a -2 on INT to resist intimidation tactics. When they reach Pain Thresholds, there is a chance they will flee as if intimidated.
		
		\textbf{Poison Resistant:} Thugs are most commonly ponies, zebras or griffins, thus they have their resistances reflecting this. They have Poison Resistance of 10 (20 if they are Zebras). Equipped armor can change these numbers.

	Thugs are the generic name given to the more downtrodden and undesirable elements of post-apocalyptic city life, lingering on street corners and alleys to either beg for a cap or two - or utilize whatever they scavenged from a dumpster to rob an unsuspecting traveller in order to score the caps for their next Dash rush. 
	
	While desperate, they aren't dumb. They may band together to bring down more dangerous opponents - as the potential rewards are bigger - but at the same time they value their life more than anything, and if things go sour they flee the scene rather quickly. Then again, one can get on their good side with a donation of caps or the chem of their desire, and thus may provide intel on the settlement they roam in.

		\textbf{Magic Resistant:} Unlike most non-mutated creatures, Timberwolf is made from twigs held together by raw, eerie magic. Due to this, they're quite resistant to magical attacks, gaining +10 to Opposed rolls to resist magic targeting them. In addition, MEWs DT Reduction doesn't work on Timberwolves.
		
		\textbf{Poison Immunity:} Due to their magical nature, the timberwolves are immune to poison.

	\subsubsection*{Description:}
	It is hard to determine what exactly a Timberwolf is; outwardly, they look like logs and twigs forming a vaguely canine shape, towering over most ponies. Their eyes are little more than green shining light. Most have came to the conclusion that timberwolf is a construct of some sort; mundane materials -wood, in this case- bound to a form by raw magic. It is unknown if they form naturally or have been created by a powerful wizard.
	
	Due to timberwolves' magical nature, they boast some rather unique talents rarely seen in any other creature. When the timberwolf falls apart they can reassemble themselves anew, and they can join forces with other timberwolf to create a larger version of a timberwolf. Perhaps due to the unique magic they possess they've developed a resistance to magic, likely part of the reason why Radiation has no effect on them.
	
	Timberwolves are by nature aggressive creatures, chasing ponies that accidentally end up in their forest-territories. However, they are quick to flee should the intruder prove to be too strong to handle by the pack. 
	A timberwolf pack is relatively small, only ten or so individuals, that further splinter into smaller hunting and scouting groups of 2-3 individuals.
	
	Though most ponies have not gained the chance to observe timberwolves in their natural habitat, it can be theorized that their social behavior resembles those of feral dogs and wolves.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Triggerblooms are mutated vegetation, having grown to larger size and much more prominent. The colours of their blooming flowers vary, but they work the same way - to thwart any possible threat to their existence, they shoot darts filled with poison against the threat. If the threat gets too close, they shift their far-spanning roots and try to get them to the ground, where they can finish them off with their darts more easily. 
	
	Triggerblooms thrive in areas with enough moisture, sunlight and radiation to satisfy their needs. These are often areas where there's vegetation to begin with, and preferably above ground. Underground Triggerblooms are a rarity, but not unheard of - provided they've sprouted near a waste barrel.
	
	The more irradiated variant, Pale Triggerbloom differs from the ordinary triggerbloom with their pale, subdued color palette, compared to the regular triggerbloom's myriad of vibrant colors. The Pale Triggerbloom is an extremely hardy plant, living in such an irradiated areas that rarely cater to any life at all. This means that they have very small amount of predators, letting them to grow in peace.

	The cheapest yet most versatile of defense mechanisms, turrets aren't just pre-War technology - often one can find them installed around bases and settlements for protection, in either salvaged or scrap-built forms. They easily provide fire in distinct areas, and with the rotational capacity can fire in almost any direction. However, their stationary nature proves to be their weakest point, as one can either bypass the turret or disable it with ease once knowing its location.
	
	Turrets can be found almost anywhere where there's requirement for passive protection. These include wasteland settlements and pre-War ruins.

		\textbf{Growing Swarm:} Twittermites are a rather special swarm in that they tend to drift further apart from each other, growing the size of their swarm from a single hex forward. This growing of sizes happens every 3 turns, with each drifting apart giving a +(2) dice to their attacks. Due its large size of swarm, explosives and other similar Area of Effect attacks consider Twittermites to be Size 0.

	Twittermite Wing (2 u. + LCK)
	
	\subsection*{Description:}
	Twittermites are very small insects that instinctively swarm to each other. As they generate a weak electric current when alone, this same electric current is further amplified when large numbers of Twittermites are within a distance of each other. They often drift further apart to better generate the electricity, which they then launch as a lightning bolt.
	
	Twittermites usually use their lightning bolts as defense rather than offense as they usually feed off of electricity; due to this they can often be seen swarming electrical equipment or latching onto creatures for their static electricity.
	
	Twittermites are strangely resistant against poisons and the mutating effect of Rads. This is potentially the result of both their diet and their electrically charged bodies frying dangerous chemicals.
	
	Twittermites are mostly benign creatures, willing to leave a pony alone if they are not disturbed.

	Robronco's finest creation to both civilian and military markets, the Ultra-Sentinel looks like an armored pony on wheels, with massive weapons attached to its metallic sides. They are, however, much bulkier than any other robot, easily filling small corridors.
	
	Ultra-Sentinel's primary goals are clear - they will keep the area secure, checking each and every passerby for identification, and if lacking proper clearance will demand them to leave before opening fire. Sometimes, however, they do not ask nicely and just unleash their massive payload on trespassers. 
	
	Ultra-Sentinels defend areas they are stationed in like the Great War never happened, carrying out its duties gallantly. Only few are ever seen roaming out in the wasteland, and even then they've been reprogrammed by a very skilled - and equally lucky - scavenger to give themselves a great guard.

	Weedlings are lamb-like creatures that are small in stature, barely bigger than a general lap dog. Unlike lap dogs, they're armed with a nasty temper and a herd mentality to take down their prey.
	
	Likely a magical construct similar to the timberwolves, weedlings are wooden lambs with thick bush of leaves for their wool, with an occasional cluster of red berries here and there. Male weedlings tend to have more berries than the females. Much like timberwolves, the weedling's eyes shine in a green color.
	
	Though weedlings are harmless on their own, the herds they gather can and often do prove fatal for a pony, as they rush to knock their targets prone in order to devour them. This is why the weedlings always appear as a swarm, travelling with a large herd of individuals, both for their own protection and to hunt. Weedlings are obligate carnivores despite being a plant.
	
	Due to being a plant, these creatures do stop what they're doing on a sunny day, in order to take in the very few and far between rays of sunshine. This concludes that the weedling can and do photosynthesize, but due to the rarity of it, have developed other means to gather nutrients.
	
	When not actively hunting, the weedlings spend most of their time resting, blending into their forest-like surroundings by curling up, making them resemble nothing more than a regular bush. This is both to hide themselves from predators such as the Moss Shambler, and to ambush any creature foolish enough to wander too close.
	Much like most other plants, weedlings are vulnerable to fire, giving off a bright green sparks when set on fire.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Windigos are nefarious spirits, known to bring with them cold and snow. They tend to seek out ponies that share hatred and fights between each other, as it is their primary source of nutrition - and the more hatred they consume, the colder the surroundings of where Windigos roam turn.
	
	Windigos do not directly engage their prey - they stay close enough to feed upon the hatred, but far enough to not make their presence known. It is only when cornered or spotted will they fight with all they got, and preferably with minimal time taken as to not disturb their ``hunting grounds''.
	
	Spotting a Windigo's presence may require some previous knowledge of the area. Sudden drop in temperature or slight snowfall in areas where there usually isn't may indicate towards the nefarious spirit's existence, especially if there's loud arguments or heavy fights in the area.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Wood-Rot Wasps are -for an insect- a large parasitoid wasp species mutated by balefire. Their most notable feature is their long stinger-like ovipositor, that they use to both fend for themselves or to lay their eggs in rotting wood, hence their name.
	
	Though they are not very aggressive, often leaving wandering ponies alone unless they feel threatened, they will attack any creature that stands between any sufficient rotting wood, be it structures, wagons or dead trees when they attempt to lay their eggs. Wood-rot wasps seem to locate the wood by scent. They can also use plant-like mutants, such as the Moss Shambler or Spore Carrier for their egg-laying.
	
	Due to the fact that females are the only ones with an ovipositor, only the females are harmful to ponies, while male wood-rot wasps are both smaller and feed entirely on nectar and other insects, such as Twittermite. The female wood-rot wasps lay 7-10 eggs inside the wood, which eventually, in a span of several months, spring forth fully developed, as their life-cycle is very fast. The adult wood-rot wasps live for a few weeks at maximum.

	\begin{verse}
		\textbf{Bite (8 AP)}: Yao Guai sometimes use their powerful jaws to cripple and pacify their foes, dealing 5+(4) damage and have a base crippling chance of 20\% with this attack.
		
		\textbf{Claws (6 AP):} The Yao Guai's claws can rip apart the weakest armors in seconds. The attack deals 3+(4) damage, and ignores 2 DT.
		
		\textbf{Irradiated attacks:} Ghoulified Yao Guai's attacks carry Radiation. Every attack has a 1x60\% chance of giving a Rad token. 
		
		\textbf{Long reach:} Ghoulified Yao Guai have considerably long forelegs, giving their Melee and Unarmed attacks additional 4 meters (2 Hex) reach.
		
		\textbf{Tight Grasp:} Ghoulified Yao Guai's strong forelegs make them excellent at grappling their foes, thus they gain +10 to all opposed rolls made to Grapple.
		
		\textbf{Woodlands Stride:} Ghoulified Yao Guai are capable of surprisingly agile movements for their size and weight, thus ignoring the +1 AP cost of Difficult Terrain.
		
		\textbf{Poison Resistant:} Despite further mutations, Ghoulfied Yao Guai are quite weak against toxins. Yao Guai's Poison Resistance is 25.
		
		\textbf{Rad Immunity:} Through further extended exposure to Radiation, Ghoulified Yao Guai have developed full immunity to Radiation.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	The Yao Guai are bears that have either lost most of their fur, or have crystalline growth and studs across their bodies. In comparison to a normal bear, they also stand taller and mightier.
	
	The origins of the term ``Yao Guai'' to name the horribly mutated bears with short temper and a lot of aggression have been lost to the time, a few arguing it may have its origins in Zebra language. Whatever the case may be, it is clear the Yao Guai do not care what you call them, only that their domain is left alone. And most often said domain is ``50 meter radius from where one is currently standing''. 
	
	The further mutation of Yao Guai, through massive Radiation exposure has reduced them in much more feral, solely on instinct driven state. However, such development has increased their size and strength considerably, while also making them impervious to Radiation, even radiating it themselves.
	
	Otherwise in behaviour, the Yao Guai do not differ from unmutated bears. They are most often solitary creatures, only meeting others of their kind for breeding purposes, and the mother looks after the newly-born Yao Guai cubs until they're large enough to defend themselves. If one does meet a Yao Guai cub on its own, the mother is close by - and viciously defends its offspring.

	\subsubsection*{Additional Combat Details:}
	\begin{verse}
		\textbf{Wasteland Weaponry:} Zebras can carry just about any weapon and armor imaginable, though often preferring their own heritage weapons. 
		
		\textbf{Shamanism:} Some zebras can use Spirits in battle, as per Tribal Shaman trait.
		
		\textbf{Alchemical Interests:} Zebras know how to brew potions and poisons, and do not shy from using them.
		
		\textbf{Abomination Hunter:} Due to their high-caliber weaponry and armor, most zebras are well-equipped to fight even the most horrid things the Wasteland has to offer. They gain a +10 to Combat skills when targeting Abominations, excluding sane Ghouls.
		
		\textbf{Zebra Language:} Zebra speak their own native language, often allowing them to strategize on the battlefield without their enemy catching on. Characters that understand Zebra language can interpret them, however.
		
		\textbf{Poison Resistant:} Zebra boast higher natural poison resistance to ponies, and often use armor to further boost their defenses. Zebra's natural poison resistance is 20.
		
		\textbf{Rad Resistant:} Zebra are just as weak to the magical radiation as their pony counterparts, giving them 5 Rad Resistance. However, they may equip armor to shield themselves from this danger.

	\subsection*{Description:}
	Zebras, the striped equine cousins of ponies, weren't exterminated by the balefire exchange between their now-fallen nation and Equestria during the Great War, just like Equestrian ponies weren't. Zebras have endured and improvised the fall of civilization while not letting their past rituals and cultural aspects get lost in time.
	
	Zebras, like ponies, are social individuals - they have their own goals and desires, though survival brings them closer to other, like-minded fellows. Thus zebras aren't inherently evil or good, it depends on the particular individual.
	
	Some zebras may have wandered to the Equestrian Wasteland from their own lands, while some are the descendants of zebras that lived in pre-War Equestria. While a few reside with ponies in same settlements, the past deeds and mistrust runs deep in some ponies, and zebras are more often than not shunned by pony communities. It is thus not unheard of zebras forming their own communities in the wilderness or ruins, away from those who may seek harm to them.
